       "[\"Phones\\n\\nModern humans today are always on their phone. They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.\\n\\nWhen people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation.\\n\\nDriving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid. No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save.\\n\\nSometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact ,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly.\\n\\nPhones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help. If you go through a problem and you can't find help you ,always have a phone there with you. Even though phones are used almost every day as long as you're safe it would come into use if you get into trouble. Make sure you do not be like this phone while you're in the middle of driving. The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones. The safest way is the best way to stay safe.    \",\n",
       " \"This essay will explain if drivers should or should not be able to use electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk. People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because bad wrecks, putting others' lives in danger, and may cause death.\\n\\nFirst of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.\\n\\nAnother reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.\\n\\nThe main key to not texting and driving while behind the wheel of a car. Mainly, it can cause tragic, terrifying, and horrific things to you and to others and that's death. That's the most important thing to not using electronic devices while operating a vehicle. With the intension, of you not keeping your eyes and staying focus on the road you can easily turn off the road or hit another victim. Possibly another humankind could go away of all flesh because of your stupidity.\\n\\nMust be remembered, always stay focus on the road so you can get to your destination safely. So, you can't cause accidents, put other people lives in danger, and possibly death. Important to realize, do not use your phone while operating a vehicle. At least, wait till you make a safe stop or until you arrive at your destination.                                                                      \",\n",
       " \"Driving while the use of cellular devices\\n\\nToday, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to another article, \"Distracted Driving\" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone.

       " \"Cell Phone Operation While Driving\\n\\nThe ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.\\n\\nWithin a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.\\n\\nConversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.\\n\\nThe creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.      \",\n",
       " 'Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road.\\n\\nDrivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around.\\n\\nThis has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world.\\n\\nThe next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.\\n\\nThis is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. \"Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.\\n\\nOverall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.\\n\\nState governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road. People should care about their lives and others around them more and should put their phones down until reaching the destination.    ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nDriving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.\\n\\nWhile driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.\\n\\nAlso best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.\\n\\nDriving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015\\n\\n¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.\\n\\nDriving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.\\n\\nTherefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.\\n\\nIn conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.   \",\n",
       " 'PHONES AND DRIVING\\n\\nIn this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.\\n\\nDrivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.\\n\\nA lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.\\n\\nMost Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.\\n\\nI cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.\\n\\nCell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.\\n\\nTalking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.   ',\n",
       " 'People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can\\'t stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn\\'t be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fatal injuries. Therefore, driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle.\\n\\nThe first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn\\'t be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor car-following ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions.\\n\\nAs stated before, these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.\\n\\nThe second reason why you shouldn\\'t operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.\\n\\nReaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you\\'re about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that, drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.\\n\\nThe last reason you shouldn\\'t drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have long-term or short-term affects. The affects can be physical, emotional, or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person\\'s ability to function normally.\\n\\nPeople who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger, fear, shock, nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people shouldn\\'t use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also, it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone, so you won\\'t be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.      ',\n",
       " 'Texting and driving\\n\\nOver half of drivers in today\\'s society have this horrible habit of texting and driving. This has to stop immediately, texting and driving puts people\\'s lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately, the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited.\\n\\nDiving more into detail, texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening. Just imagine you\\'re on the road driving to your friend\\'s house and someone shoots you a text. You look down not even for 5 seconds; then you accidents swerve into the next lane hitting a car. There are so many different scenarios that could go wrong in that situation. Your life is over just because you couldn\\'t wait to text your friend. The consequences that texting and driving comes with just isn\\'t worth it.\\n\\nThe cost of a life shouldn\\'t be worth a text message, Snapchat or Instagram DM (Direct Message). Texting and driving has taken many lives. In a recent article I read it said \"2017 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics. In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2017, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.\" This cannot go on any longer we must do something to stop these numbers from increasing.\\n\\nLuckily the government has enforced a brand new law called \"Hands Free\".\\n\\nThis law states Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving. If you don\\'t follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars. I feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society.\\n\\nOver all texting and driving is dangerous, has killed many people and is now on the decline thanks to the new \" Hands Down\" law.

       " \"explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle\\n\\nDrivers shouldn't be able to use their phones when driving because they can be severely injured or worse die. The number of crashes related to a phone and texting have made the use of a phone while driving illegal. Also the non use of a cell phone behind the wheel saves countless lives everyday.\\n\\nSome states have also enacted laws to ban cell phone use. In the United States risk of automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than if they weren't on their phone.\\n\\nDriving with a cell phone has been the main cause of vehicle crashes over the last decade. Which led to most states banning the use of the device completely. However One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Strong evidence that both retrieving and, in particular, sending text messages has a detrimental effect on that individual that increases their urge to use it. Although using a hands free device may sound better however in reality it's not since your attention isn't always on the road. All drivers should refrain from there cell phones.      \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.\\n\\nAny form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.\\n\\nUsing a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.\\n\\nIt's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.\\n\\nDrivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone.

The generation now don\\'t know the meaning of texting and driving. There are bad wrecks happening while driving and texting on the road. Drivers should never use their phone while driving. On your phone can really cause you to swerve off and on the road leading you to be in the other persons lane. Taking your eyes off the road has obvious disadvantages and it degrades our attention.\\n\\n90% of car crashes is mostly the drivers fault, they mostly use the excuse of \"recognition error\". When you are in a divided conversation your attention is in different places like the road, a person in the car with you, or a phone call. All those distractions only one should mainly have your attention which i suggest be the road, and us as human we only have a little of attention to spare. Texting on a phone while driving can make you react more slowly to what your main focus should be on. We also feel immune to the risks of other people. Many of us have a lot of experience making bad decisions and suffering the consequences. It feels reasonable to infer that we are able to text and drive safely but some people may chose not to thinking they can do them all in any way.

       " 'Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone\\n\\nBeing on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nOne leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.\\n\\nWhen you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.\\n\\nFor some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.\\n\\nAfter all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.\\n\\nYou are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.   ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving Essay\\n\\nI believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.\\n\\nFurthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.\\n\\nFinally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.        \",\n",
       " \"Although cell phones have been around for quite some time, they have become a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for anything now such as: texting, social media, calls, schedule planning, etc. Unfortunately, we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place, while we are driving. As time is going by, we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons.\\n\\nWhen we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life, but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life.\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now, we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the hand-free is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone.\\n\\nDriving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause, it causes someone's insurance to rise, and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to be/cause an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 24/7 and we don't usually put it down. We are distracted by our phones to the point where we shouldn't be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones. Driving and texting should be banned before we lose more people.      \",\n",
       " \"Have you ever seen an ambulance or two with a few cop cars rushing by and thought what's going on? Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.\\n\\nMany people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.\\n\\nAnother reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.\\n\\nA way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.                 \",\n",

Paring this and driving is not a good combination, why you shouldn't do it and how it effects people.\\n\\nDrivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. For example, It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill them self or other people.\\n\\nReports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because of texting and driving. There are a lot of other reasons why not to do it to. First of you must set an example towards the passengers that are in your car rather it be your kids or you friends. Secondly its illegal in a lot of places but Texas is one of the only seven states that have yet to completely ban texting and driving. Lastly and the one that gets told a lot is that your eyes are taken off the road, A person is 23 times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving.

In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses. The reason I say that the law enforcement benefit from the problem would have to be because this is an example of exactly what it is that they try so hard to avoid. Funeral homes benefit because most of these cases end in a tragic accident that allow the funeral home to prepare a home going ceremony. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person continue to text and drive. People really need to understand how easily it is take the life of someone else or even themselves. And most of the time in many cases relating to this particular problem, it is always is the age groups ranging from 16 years of age to 30 years of age. I wish that this problem can get resolved quickly to avoid many accidents and death.    \",\n",

Statistically, 50 minutes of phone chatter while driving increases the likelihood of a car crash or car accident almost five-fold (Crundall, 2017). Texting has also emerged as an issue but many reported cases indicate talking on the cell phone while driving. In the United States, 20 states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones, while another 48 states have banned text messaging while driving (National Conference of State Legislature [NCSL], 2019). Surprisingly, no state is yet to pass laws banning cell phone use across a multitude of drivers, and this explains the continued rise in cell phone-use induced car and road accidents. The majority of drivers and motorists claims that \\'being distracted by mobile phones\" is the leading cause of car and road accidents.\\n\\nOne major issue concerns the risk of using one hand to navigate bends and respond to potential hazards while talking on the phone. According to Crundall (2017), the majority of roads accidents in Europe occur in steep slopes, bends and corners, with 35% of them involving the driver communicating on his/her cell phone. Another issue involves the act of conversation which leads to a loss of concentration - cognitive processing - that ultimately leads to an accident (NCSL, 2019). Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University conducted a simulation study and discovered that the human spatial brain activity is affected when performing dual-task, leading to loss of concertation and hence accidents (Crundall, 2017). Processing of auditory messages becomes a problem when driving and communicating on a cell phone, explaining why a driver, under no circumstances, is required to use his/her cell phone while driving.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCrundall, D.

       " \"Phone and Driving\\n\\nThroughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.\\n\\nPeople that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.\\n\\nIn the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.\\n\\nWays that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.   \",\n",
       " 'Cell phones were presented within the United States showcase within the decade of 1980 and their utilization right away developed amid the following two decades. The slant of utilizing cell phones has expanded all through the world. One of the essential reasons for the tremendous development of cell phones is that they encourage communication advertising tall levels of adaptability coming to craved individuals inside seconds whether he/she is at office, domestic, or exterior driving a car etc. Cell phones back in making a coordinate contact with individuals successfully and without wastage of any time. Another fundamental reason for the hazardous development of cell phones is the security viewpoint. Cell phones make it simple to contact amid crisis indeed amid driving in spite of the fact that utilizing cell phones whereas driving is generally perilous and not fitting, it gives the comfort of handling crisis circumstance, tuning in music through hands-free, and following courses etc.\\n\\nIn case drivers on cell phones have more mischances, at that point drivers ought to be precluded from utilizing them. Drivers on cell phones do have more mishaps. Hence, drivers ought to be disallowed from utilizing cell phones. To create this contention, you must clarify and protect both of its premises, and they require very diverse contentions.\\n\\nA few investigations recommend that talking on a cell phone whereas driving is viably like driving whereas impeded. In reality, a ponder at the College of Utah that compared tanked drivers to drivers on cell phones indeed found that \"cell phone drivers displayed more noteworthy impedance than inebriated drivers\". Ouch. A costly mineral called coltan may be a component of cell phones. It can stand up to warm and store an electrical charge. It\\'s found basically in locales of the Equitable Republic of Congo, and the mining and generation preparation regularly includes child/youth work and natural dangers.\\n\\nEleven states have sanctioned a few sort of confinements with respect to cell phone utilization whereas driving. For illustration, Arizona forbids transport drivers from employing a cell phone whereas operating a transport. Florida incorporates a particular law concerning cell phones with headsets, stipulating that the headset permits exterior sounds to be listened through at slightest one ear. Modern Shirt does not permit drivers beneath age 21 with a learner\\'s allow to utilize a cell phone whereas driving. Modern York\\'s law, ordered in 2001, is the foremost broad.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nShould drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle. According to the article \"Cellphone Use While Driving Statistics and Texting and Driving Facts\" states that according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. \"Talking or texting while driving or checking social media posts takes eyes off the brain off the task of driving\":\\n\\nstates a message that phones has become a distraction to the human brain, but not only distracting the human brain, but is also becoming a habit to human beings.\\n\\nDistraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people\\'s injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn\\'t come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.\\n\\nSo for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .

       " \"I am typing about why drivers should not use phones while driving. This is my opinion and I will be backing it up. It is also a law all over the world. Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving.\\n\\nI say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.\\n\\nIf you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.    \",\n",
       " \"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nPeople whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\\n\\nPeople say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.                                                      \",\n",
       " 'Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving\\n\\nDrivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.\\n\\nOver 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the \"new drunk driving\" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.\\n\\nWhile it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a \"hands free law\" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.\\n\\nThe hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.         ',\n",
       " 'BOOM!! You\\'re on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911.\\n\\nAt this point you\\'re thinking to yourself, \"why the freak did this happen?\" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other\\'s lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.\\n\\nTexting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.\\n\\nand be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.\\n\\nCellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What\\'s more important to you: a notification or somebody\\'s life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don\\'t know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.\\n\\nWe dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.      ',\n",
       " 'I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing ones insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with the their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the electronic device. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about it also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason to ban the ususage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nLook around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.\\n\\nPhones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. \"About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year\" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article \"Mobile phones and driving safety\", it stated that,\"In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving.\" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.\\n\\nMany people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of \" Teen driver source\", \"In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.\"The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on \"Science Daily\\' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.\\n\\nBoth the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.\\n\\nEach state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don\\'t listen the people in charge of the state they\\'ve made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn\\'t learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn\\'t right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It\\'s not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.       ',\n",
       " 'Imagine waking up to a call in the middle of the night saying you lost your loved one in a car accident because they decided a text was more important than their life? Texting while driving increases the risk of an accident 23.2 times compared to unimpaired driving which is a sobering statistic provided by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in 2018. Using the phone while driving has spread throughout the nation, and with people being so impatient in today\\'s society, texting and driving has had damaging effects on people and their families. Phones have become a key part of our lives but it\\'s our job as people to know when and where to use our phones especially as drivers. Driving while distracted by the phone can affect everyone involved physically, mentally, as well as financially.\\n\\nDriving and texting is something very common, but a serious problem with detrimental effects. The main detrimental effect could be physical. When a person texts and drives, a person could cause an accident, which could not only endanger themselves, but it could endanger others.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council, \"Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.\" These are deaths added to this already hectic world that could have been easily avoided.\\n\\nNot only can texting while driving affect a person physically but it can also affect a person mentally.\\n\\nWhile physical damage to a vehicle or physical injury to a person can often be resolved in a matter of days or weeks, emotional damage may last a lifetime. Author and blogger Rebecca Goldfarb recently categorized the types of emotional damage as shock, anger, guilt, anxiety and depression and even post-traumatic stress. Goldfarb added many people who are involved in an accident as either the driver or as the victim often need to receive professional care if the difficult emotions are lasting longer than expected.\\n\\nThe final way in which driving while distracted may negatively affect a person is financially. According to the website big AZ BIG Media, there are six types of costs that may happen following a car accident. The first two immediate financial costs involve the repair of personal property and the costs with healthcare and medical treatment. The second two financial costs involve possible legal fees and an increase to car insurance. Finally, the last two costs involve the loss of employment (income and benefits) and the possible cost of a career change if the person cannot return to their job.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting while driving is not a wise decision. Texting while driving can negatively affect everyone involved physically, mentally and even financially. Oprah Winfrey summarized this point on April 26, 2010 on her website with these words \"But this is a real problem we can do something about and get immediate results. All we have to do is hang up or switch off. It really is that simple. Once we do that, not another son or daughter will have to die because someone was on the phone and behind the wheel-and just not paying attention.\" The solution is simple, don\\'t text and drive.

       " \"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody      \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nPhones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn\\'t be allowed.\\n\\nIn many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.\\n\\nAs a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (\"Distracted Driving\") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.\\n\\nEveryone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people\\'s life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you\\'ll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDistracted Driving | Motor Vehicle Safety | CDC Injury Center. 16 Sept. 2019, www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html.

       " \"There shouldn't be a discussion when it comes to texting and driving for obvious reasons. It's just as dangerous as driving under the influence. And there are plenty of ways to send a message using hands free technology. It also being illegal should really mean that you shouldn't be doing it. And you can also kill someone just to send a text message. But it is common in the United States.\\n\\nTexting and driving has been banned in most of the United States there are only 2 states that haven't banned texting and driving. And of you get caught by a cop you will be fined up to $400. And that is a lot of money for just sending a text. And may also cause your license to get suspended. It makes sense because when you text and drive you are twenty three percent more likely to get into a car crash. That makes just as dangerous as driving under the influence.\\n\\nA lot of people don't actually know how dangerous and common texting and driving really is. It makes up eighteen percent of fatal car crashes. And more than 35 percent of teens and adults admit to texting and driving. So even though people know what could happen they still do it either way. And more then ninety percent of people know how dangerous texting and driving is. People take there eyes off the road for four seconds on average which is long enough for you to swerve on to another lane. And at least 9 people are killed every day by distracted drivers.\\n\\nThere are plenty of easy ways to prevent texting and driving. One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion texting and driving and driving distracted is a big problem that can easily be avoided. But people still tend to do it anyways. People should pay a fine if caught by a police officer. And should get there license suspended if they do it a lot. People should be more aware about the consciences that can be caused by this petty action. To keep it simple would you drive 1 ton of pure machinery at 60 miles per hour blindfolded.     \",\n",
       " 'Not Using Phones while Driving\\n\\nThroughout the years, teenagers have been eager to turn 16. Driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time. There is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire. Even though there is a good side, there is a bad side as well. This would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this. I would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving , my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away, a phone is a big distraction, and it is a law you have to follow.\\n\\nMy first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday. Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse, dead. A phone call or text can wait, but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents, crashes, distractions, and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.\\n\\nMy second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because, too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason. Once again, using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example, phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.\\n\\nMy third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because, a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore. The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law, a new law means that it is expected to be followed, a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion, i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.\\n\\nA phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation, it can wait. My reasons, once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away, it is also a big distraction, and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction.\\n\\nThrough the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it, before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.

       " \"Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?\\n\\nDrivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.\\n\\nSomething as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.\\n\\nI would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.\\n\\nThe general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\\n\\nThe statistics?\\n\\nWhile driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.   \",\n",
       " \"Texting and Driving\\n\\nDriving will always need your undivided attention at all times. There are many obvious reasons you shouldn't text and drive. You can get in a wreck, hit a pedestrian, and it puts your life at risk. Driving is a privilege and you should always follow the rules of the road. Using your mobile device can put you and the people around you in danger.\\n\\nFirst of all, Texting and driving can get you in a terrible car wreck. When your on your phone your reaction time is bad. You can miss a stop sign and another car can come from the left or right side of you and you wouldn't see it coming. This can also raise your insurance rate up or you can be sued depending on how bad the accident is. Why risk it when you can wait or pull over to send that text? When you're looking down might not see pedestrians cross the street.\\n\\nBesides getting into a car wreck you can also injure another person for being careless. Driving in a neighborhood needs your full attention. If you use your mobile device in a neighborhood you can either hit a pet, a jogger, or even a child if you're not paying attention. If such thing happens you can either get sued or go to jail for manslaughter. This is another major reason why you shouldn't be using your phone on the road.\\n\\nMost importantly, getting distracted by your cell phone can put your life and other people's lives at risk. The most common deaths road deaths are caused by someone who were on their phones. You crashing can also cause a domino effect with other cars hitting each other on an intersection or a highway. That one text is not worth putting your life and other people's lives at risk. You don't want to end up in the hospital or even worse end up dead.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should never use your phone while driving under no circumstances. If you need to make an emergency call, you should invest in a bluetooth hands free radio to make your phone calls. It is your duty to make the road you drive in safe for yourself and others. Make sure your eyes are always on the road no matter what.   \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn today\\'s current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.\\n\\nCell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (\"Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks.\" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn\\'t a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.\\n\\nIn 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(\"Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving.\" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.\\n\\nThese statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.            ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn this day in age of technological advancement, mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones. It has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do. There seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on. That in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehicle.\\n\\nThere is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention. There are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it. It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise, with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way, driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together, the ending result are what you would expect it to be, catastrophic.\\n\\nCellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that, we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead (assuming there is any that is). They do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result. This most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time. It was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers. You would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it, but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this, providing more fatality rates to go up. Add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happen.\\n\\nIn the end, we just should not use our phones while we drive. It quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well. It can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer. We should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone. There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle, we just choose the most dangerous route.\\n\\nTaylor 2            \",\n",
       " \"Young adults and teens can not put their phone down for a second. Any notification they receive is so important to them. The first thing they do is check and see what popped up on their phone. The worst time for this to happen is when they're driving because they will still cheak no matter what they're doing. Using your phone while driving can cause you to get a ticket, cause you to hurt someone, and even cause you to hurt yourself.\\n\\nPeople may think nothing of driving and being on their phone. Police always advertise to let others know not to use their phones while driving but they refuse to listen. Now if a police officer catch anyone on their phone while driving they will get a ticket. Everyone hates when authority stops them. It's the worst feeling ever and to make it worst is for the reason to be just being on your phone.\\n\\nIf people are driving and on their phone they're not focused on what's in front of them. Anything can pop up in front of the vehicle at any time. Things like animals, people, and even cyclist can appear in front once you up from your phone. The only problem is the driver may not look up in time and hit someone or something. There is a possibility that whoever the driver hit could suffer major injuries or even death.\\n\\nNot only are you putting others in danger, you're also putting yourself in danger. Like mentioned before, anything can pop up in front of you vehicle. This time around it can be another car, truck, or even a bus. Crashing into one these just from being on a phone can possibility cause instant death. Maybe you might have quick reflexes and try to avoid collision. There is a possibility still hit something else like a tree. Some may be lucky enough to only be injured or not harmed at all.\\n\\nIn the end, using your phone while driving can result in you getting in serious trouble or causing harm to yourself and others. Authority can stop you if they notice it. Other citizens can harmed by you for not paying attention. Also you can harm yourself. Just do not do it because it's not worth it. It can wait.   \",\n",
       " \"Have you ever been behind someone that has been on there phone and didn't know the light was green or when someone almost hit you because they didn't see you because they were looking at their phone?\\n\\nTo start things off, I believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel. If you are at a red light and you don't have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone. Since we are in the time and age were we have Bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls. Texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger. No one's parents should have to attend their child's funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving. There are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheel.\\n\\nSecondly, with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles. Now with these cars we don't need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheel.\\n\\nEvery day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the United States but with today's technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesn't seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel. Some people still might not agree with me on what I believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in today's society that no one can get hurt from texting and driving.\\n\\nLastly, although it's a big problem for people to stop texting and driving, it's not a ban in every state in the United States. It's said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isn't the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which I know doesn't sound great but it's kind of the truth in a way. I personally have no experience of this because I can't drive but i see people who do drive and do this and it's not like it's every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it. Now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers also.\\n\\nIt's taken the USA almost 14 years and people still don't listen to no texting and driving.\\n\\nTo conclude, have you ever been behind some or seen someone texting and driving? I got to tell you some facts that maybe you didn't know about texting and driving and even I learned something new. I also gave some changes that could happen in the near future that could change how we see texting and driving.       \",\n",
       " \"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.\\n\\nDriving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.\\n\\nI believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.\\n\\nAccording to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.      \",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t Touch the Screen\\n\\nAs we drove to the final basketball game of the season against our rivals Milton High School, I was having a great time with my best friend. Paige and I were stopped at the intersection on Highway 9 when a white SUV crashed into the back of her Nissan Rogue. We were both rushed to the hospital where my friend learned that her leg was broken in two places. Paige could not finish the rest of her swim season and was absolutely devastated. We later found out that the driver behind us was looking down at her cell phone and didn\\'t notice that the light had turned red. The driver\\'s one second of distracted driving affected my best friend\\'s life for months although, thankfully, her use of a cell phone did not end it. As a result of the risk to the public, drivers should not be allowed to use handheld cell phones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nOperating a vehicle requires attention and focus. Anything that interrupts a driver\\'s concentration leads to a dangerous distraction. Three main types of distracted driving are visual, manual, and cognitive. Drivers who text and drive, snap and drive, instagram and drive, or simply call home while driving are endangering the public. Texting while driving is particularly harmful because it combines all three types of distracted driving . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers who send or read a text while driving lose concentration and take their eyes off the road for up to five seconds. Those five seconds of using a handheld cell phone are a great risk to the public.\\n\\nStatistics show that using a handheld phone while operating a moving vehicle risks the welfare of the public. In \"Cell Phone Use and Driving,\" Louis Hugo Francescutti states that using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of collisions four to six times, and drivers are twice as often to be in a rear-end collision. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nine people are killed each day, and the public is involved in more than one-thousand car crashes due to distracted driving. Francescutti writes that researchers believe that distracted driving causes twenty-five to ninety percent of car collisions. Clearly, these statistics demonstrate the danger of distracted driving.\\n\\nAlthough distracted driving causes over four thousand deaths each year, there are solutions to this tragedy. One obvious solution is not using the phone at all while driving; however, other possible solutions include the use of bluetooth and phone mounts to decrease the number of deaths. Since driving requires attention and focus, making the choice not to use the phone while driving limits the risk to the driver and to the public. When absolutely necessary, the use of bluetooth and phone mounts can offer drivers phone access while still protecting the public. These two alternatives should only be used in case of an emergency.\\n\\nClearly, operating a vehicle while using a handheld cell phone is dangerous. Georgia recognized these dangers and passed legislation to prevent the use of handheld devices when driving; however, some drivers fail to follow the law. The driver who caused my accident received a citation for using her device while driving. Hopefully, the next time she goes out on the road she will think about the danger to others and act responsibly.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Distracted Driving.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nhttps://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/Distracted_Driving/index. html.\\n\\nAccessed 19 Mar. 2020.\\n\\nFrancescutti, Louis Hugo. \"Cell Phone Use and Driving.\" Encyclopedia of Lifestyle Medicine &\\n\\nHealth, edited by James M.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones have become a key factor in many lives today. People tend to use cell phones for just about any and everything. As a people, we tend to rely on our phones at any given moment. Since the invention of telephones, society has been using phones for texting, talking, social media, etc. For those uses, cell phones have put us at risk. We tend to use or cell phones when we are walking across the street, and most importantly when we are driving. Operating a car while texting/talking results in the driver becoming a hazard to other drivers on the road.\\n\\nFirstly, there is no doubt that we are addicted to our phones. Our phones have led us to be distracted. A distraction is something that prevents someone from giving their full attention to something else. For instance, when we are driving, we hear our phones ring and instantly we pick it up to answer. It is the inner use telling us that we are amazing drivers, and that one little call will not distract us from the road. In all reality, one little phone call does distract us from when the light changes, or when someone needs to get over to the other lane. Cell phones reduce driving performance.\\n\\nAs well as that, drivers have to operate both the phone and the car, which leads to car accidents. Using the cell phone and driving the car at the same time, reduces the drivers ability to concentrate on the road. All it takes is two seconds to look down at the phone, and the next thing you know, you have caused a life or yours. Car accidents are well known in the community to be caused by texting and driving. Not to mention, being on the phone and driving-slows down reactions to traffic lights and other traffic events, which also causes car accidents. Equally important, during bad weather on slippery road, engaging in conversation equals to paying less attention to the road increasing fatal accidents.\\n\\nAlthough, there are negative impacts of texting and driving, it could also be beneficial. The beneficial parts could consists of using it for emergency purposes. For example, calling for assistance on the side of the road, reporting an incident while driving, or simply calling for help. In addition, cell phones can be used for navigation to an unknown destination. Cell phones always provide you with information about news, weather, and alerts for any city you are driving in.\\n\\nIn conclusion,it can be concluded that texting is not only an effective way of communication, but always a safety concern. Different studies have shown that many accidents are caused by phones and driving daily. Phones and driving is a dangerous habit people have picked up on. How many people are going to have to get hurt before realize their actions have consequences? We have to understand that phones and driving is extremely dangerous, and has to be stopped.\\n\\n2            ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving Essay\\n\\nMost humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!\\n\\nFirst, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.\\n\\nSecond, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.\\n\\nLastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nPhones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.\\n\\nThere is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International\\n\\nTravel, \"Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.\\n\\nEach year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world\\'s roads, on average over 1,000 a day.\" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.\\n\\nSome of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.\\n\\nPeople have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nMy own prior knowledge through a Driver Safety Class https://www. asirt. org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/         ',\n",
       " \"Phones and their impact on driving\\n\\nPhone use while driving has become extremely common in this day and age. Almost everyone that's driven a car has done it, and they know it. A lot of people do it, but that obviously doesn't make it right. Of course lots of things have come out so that we won't have the phone in our hands while driving, but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem? Phones cause for distractions, accidents, and possibly even jail time.\\n\\nThe last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted. I think I could say the same thing for a passenger. Have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phone?\\n\\nHave they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving? It's not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life. Hands-free calls are good but just because they don't have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phone.\\n\\nDistraction due to phones could result in multiple things. One of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt. In the state of Georgia, Pedestrians are given the right-of-way when crossing a marked crosswalk. Pedestrians are required to yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk. If drivers aren't paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver. Drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrian.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons for car wrecks in the United States is not driving under the influence or speeding. The main cause for car wrecks in America is distracted driving. People don't realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck. Looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really doesn't even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happen.\\n\\nWhen using your phone while driving, you should ask yourself a few questions. Do I want to possibly go to jail today? Do I want to possibly crash today? Do I want to possibly take a life today? These are questions you should ask yourself before picking up that phone and reading that text or even talking to someone on the phone. Don't be selfish. Think about other people and the impact that using your phone while driving could possibly have on others. Put the phone down and get where you need to go.                                                                                                                                                                                             \",\n",
       " 'PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nIn today\\'s day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can\\'t get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn\\'t be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIn my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you\\'re taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn\\'t be able to use your cellphone while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason that you shouldn\\'t be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of \"answering a quick text\" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people\\'s lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.\\n\\nThe last and final reason is that it\\'s illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!\\n\\nIn conclusion, people shouldn\\'t be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don\\'t pick up the phone.    ',\n",
       " 'Should People Use Their Cellphones While Driving?\\n\\nOver the year many states have banned using cellphones while driving. Some people tend not to listen and still use it and that causes a lot of people lives. Should people use their phone while driving? No one should be using their cellphones while driving. It\\'s not safe for you, the person next to you, or the person that you hit, insurance rate goes up, and its illegal.\\n\\nPeople thinks that they can use their phones while driving but end up causing people lives even themselves. In 2018 half a million people were injured because of texting and driving. In an article of \"Facts & Statistics About Texting & Driving (Updated for 2018)\" it claims \"With the latest statistics available as of 2018, in 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation, 3,477 people died and another 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes caused by drivers who were distracted because they were texting or using cell phones.\" Don\\'t let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the roads.\\n\\nDepending on what auto insurance people have, when you get into an accident your insurance will go up. In an article \"Just how much does car insurance go up after an accident?\" it said that \"Insurers once followed the Insurance Services Office\\'s (ISO) standard of increasing a premium by 20 to 40 percent of the insurer\\'s base rate after an accident.\" If you drive a brand new car that you pay for it, you wouldn\\'t want your insurance to higher then your car bills. Specially if you are a young adult trying to figure things out, you will be making the worst mistake if you let your phone have your attention.\\n\\nIn most state it\\'s illegal to text while driving. There are 41 state that ban texting while driving because of distractions. In the article \"Texting While Driving May Be Common, But It\\'s Illegal In Most States\" it stated,\\n\\n\"In all but four of those states, texting while driving is a primary offense, meaning you can get pulled over and ticketed simply for that alone; in Florida, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio, you can get ticketed for texting only if you were pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding. (By comparison, only 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., ban all drivers from using handheld mobile phones.)\" Don\\'t get distracted and get pulled over because your friends or family is texting you. If anything it only takes a minute to pull over and do what you need to do. You don\\'t want anything to happen to your safety.\\n\\nLife is too short for anyone to risk it. Witnessing a distracted driver is very scary, life is never promised for tomorrow. Rethink about your choice, is it that important to risk anything? People are way too naive to know what\\'s right from wrong, moral of the story don\\'t text while driving.               ',\n",
       " 'Today, there are many controversial conversations on people using their phones while driving. Some People may think that phones should be allowed to be used for certain reasons such as GPS and other emergency uses while others believe that phones should not be used at all due to accidents and law violations. If people were able to use their phones and be a responsible driver at once, just maybe there would not be a problem with it nowadays.\\n\\nEven though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths, I believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving. Sometimes, people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need to see in order to try and fix the situation if it is a fixable situation. Some people also have their phone for uses of GPS and other informational services. Not all people use their phones as a distraction while driving. Some people just need it at the time.\\n\\nEven though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea, there are many cons to this idea. A lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device. Phones have cause a lot of deaths, not just in America but across the world. I believe there should be more laws made that does not ban phones but put restrictions on them like time restrictions. Example: A law that prevents you from using your phone after 8:00 pm or a law that prevents you from using your phone on certain streets.\\n\\nAll in all, i do believe using your phone while driving is not that bad of an idea as long as people can use it responsible while driving.

       " 'Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life\\'s. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.\\n\\nImage a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying \"we need to talk\". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility\\'s that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn\\'t pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.\\n\\nNot only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there\\'s a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn\\'t stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.\\n\\nIn conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.    ',\n",
       " \"The use of cars and mobile technology has done nothing but grow in our society without ceasing. However, the use of these cellular devices while driving can be fatal to the driver and to others. If the driver is overly distracted and is not paying attention, it can cause them to veer off the road or hit innocent, bystanding, pedestrians. The use of technology could also be used for good. GPS helps most people on this earth, get to where they need to go. Although, this can also lead to them getting distracted, some apps have it, so that the driver can simply hear the directions. The usage of cellular devices shouldn't be restricted completely, but limited to using GPS.\\n\\nThe amount of car accidents due to drivers being distracted by their phones, is at 1.6 million per year. This is mostly texting and driving, or being on social media while operating a vehicle. Actively using phones while driving should be restricted because of the danger to the driver, passengers, and the pedestrians that are around. Most of the drivers that are making these mistakes, are teenagers that don't know better. Teen drivers, or new drivers in general, should take a proper drivers ed class, that'll teach them proper drivers etiquette. This will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving, and teach them techniques to avoid temptation.\\n\\nAlthough the use of cell phones should be restricted, it shouldn't be completely prohibited. Drivers often use their phones for GPS in this day and age. If phones are permanently prohibited, then drivers won't be able to use their mobile map. It navigates the driver to where they need to go. Apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their GPS hands-free. They also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesn't feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions. All the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving. Phones while driving doesn't need to be prohibited.\\n\\nSome people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident. While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible. Although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents, it's not the cause for ALL of them. Phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens. In fact, drunk driving is the cause for 31% of car accidents that occur in the country. Taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle, will have a poor effect on the drivers who need GPS to go to new places and don't end up lost. It will lead to drivers needing maps, which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of.\\n\\nGetting rid of cell phone use while driving completely, may seem like a smart idea at first, but it doesn't make sense once really contemplated. It would alter the country's way of driving, and not in a good way. Maybe there would be less accidents, but there are still drunk drivers to worry about. Cell phone usage while driving should not be strictly prohibited, but rather restricted for all uses except for GPS.                    \",\n",

Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.\\n\\nAccording to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. \"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it\\'s that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.\\n\\nIn the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that \"U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.\"Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.\\n\\nTexting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch \"Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions\".\\n\\nAlso,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nDriving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created \\'do not disturb\\' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.\\n\\nThere have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it\\'s more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Learn About Distracted Driving\", enddd. org, https://www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoPL2BRDxARIsAE Mm9y-oHT6Mk_WAg5wlCemcRyFHp5lNweKjRnTrS7g2UC3ilT0pQ_35ipcaAucdEALw_wc Baccessed day: 6/5/20\\n\\n\"Family Safe Driving Agreement\", enddd. org, https://www. enddd. org/simple-steps-we-can-take-for-safer-driving/ , accessed day: 6/5/20         ',\n",

If you have kids in the car and you texting while driving and you do not pay attention to the road and your coming on to a traffic light and it's red a car is in front of you, and then you hit the car you could kill you and your kids just from that one big detraction on the road. Say if you lived and you kids died you are going to jail and you have to go to court to pay the people who you hit from behind that one mistake could lead to all of that. Anything can and could put your family in risk and you in risk for your life. You're driving in your car so someone who you know or love text you. A person walking across the road you're not paying attention at all you hit them they lived lucky lived when you hit them, so they stay in the hospital a good 2-3 weeks the police come to the hospital convince the person you hit to sue you they do it. In the mail or the police that convince they person that you hit come to your house and tell you that you have been sued for texting and driving on the road because the traffic lights has a camera on it catches you. Your court day comes up either your license get suspended or you have to pay the person you hit money. It might end up as both. This why people should not text & drive.   \",\n",
       " \"Today in society cell phones play a huge part in deaths because people use their cell phones while driving because they want to text, call, take pictures, and or even being on social media. As people continue to depend on cellphones for their communication needs these devices not only become more useful but also more dangerous, especially when people are using their phones at the wrong times. The most dangerous time to use your phone is when you are driving. If you use your phone while you are driving, you are taking a huge risk on losing your life or taking someone else's life. The action of many countries around the world to ban the use of cell phones while driving may have served to deter drivers from using their phones as they drive.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons that make using cell phones while driving very dangerous is that using the cell phone reduces a driver's reaction time in traffic. On busy roads, the amount of time that one talks before reacting to a situation in most cases determines whether someone gets to continue living. It is very dangerous to text and call while driving but texting while driving is more dangerous because the driver must constantly keep looking at the phone screen in order to type or read the messages. Studies show that people who text while driving tend to accelerate more slowly after stepping on the brakes, this can cause irregularities for another driver leading to possible accidents and since their eyes are more on the text than the road, drivers who choose to text while driving have a much higher chance of hitting a pedestrian than those not distracted in driving.\\n\\nMany accidents, whether severe or not, usually occur within a blink of an eye. This means that just a moment of distraction is enough for a driver to cause a serious road accident. Given the many concerns, it is best if drivers were not only banned from texting but banned from their phones in any way at all as they drive.   \",\n",

Many wrecks have been caused by people texting and driving. You could look up at the road one second too late and take someone's life.\\n\\nMost teens are addicted to their phone and right when it buzzes, they grab it and check it. They can't even drive without them. You could swerve while on your phone, stop too late, or never see the person walking. Just like that someone's hurt and its your fault. Driving is a serious thing. You don't have to just worry about your life but the other peoples on the road's life too. Not everyone can see the same thing, so all your attention needs to be on the road.\\n\\nThat's why you shouldn't drive and be on your phone. Its very dangerous and can take someone's life. You never know when that day will be. You can never be certain on what will happen. That's why you should always be safe and not do it. Think before you take someone's life.      \",\n",

Texting and driving are six times more likely to cause an accident than driving intoxicated. Over 1.6 million crashes a year in the US are linked to cell phone distraction. There needs to be something done to stop this.\\n\\nIf someone is caught texting and driving, there should be a worse punishment than a small ticket. People are putting people in danger every single day doing this. Approximately 660,000 people are using their phones right now while driving. Texting and driving are considered the most dangerous activity to do while driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries a year are caused from texting and driving. Texting causes a 400% increase of distraction while driving.\\n\\nEven people that text and drive want something to be done about it. 94% percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and 74% of drivers support a ban of hand-held cell phone use while driving. A AAA poll showed that 94% of teen drivers know about the cell phone laws and the dangers of doing it, and 35% admitted to doing it. 21% percent of all teen accidents are caused by cell phone usage. Teens are 4 times likely to get into an accident or a near miss than an adult when talking or texting on a cell phone. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017. 15,341 people between the age of 15-29 have been involved in fatal accidents involving cell phone usage.\\n\\nThere is too much risk involving cell phones and driving, thousands of people die a year involving cell phones.

       " \"Drivers should absolutely never be able to use a cell phone while driving. This is evident as in recent years there has been a big problem in our society with drivers using their cell phones while driving. It has gotten so bad that it has become illegal because driving while using a cell phone is more likely to be the cause of a fatal accident, than when a person drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nUse a hands free device at all times while driving. I say this because a cell phone will take your attention off of the task at hand. A driver's focus should be maintained on only driving to ensure safety. It has been proven that driving while using a cell phone is the cause of more vehicular accidents resulting in a fatality than those caused by drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\\n\\nIn two thousand and thirteen there were three thousand one hundred fifty-four people killed in distracted driver related crashes. In just one year's time, there are three hundred and ninety thousand people injured in accidents caused by texting and driving. I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.\\n\\nI also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications. In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed. In addition, it will not allow you to access absolutely any of your social media platforms or let you get social media notifications while you are driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my opinion on whether drivers should be using their cell phones while driving is that they should refrain from using their cell phone while driving. This is because driving is a task that requires a lot of focus and a cell phone is very distracting.\\n\\nDriving while using a cell phone is now illegal because of how dangerous it is.        \",\n",

You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up.

And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.\\n\\nInConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today.

This could be safe because that important phone call could save a life. If you didn't answer your phone something whose could of happened.\\n\\nI believe that it could be life taking because going down the highway going 60 and running into someone would be pretty bad for everyone.

Even if your rates don't go up after an accident, you could lose your good drivers discount.\\n\\nMany of us want the right to text and drive in our cars, but study shows that texting while driving causes accidents. For the people driving older cars, texting while driving is a safety hazard. It's Now Illegal to Text while druving, due to the many accidents.

Also, talking to passengers can affect you driving skills, even though it's socially accepted and nearly unsafe.\\n\\nTexting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk to.

It helps control people and make roads safer.\\n\\nI believe you should be able to listen to your music on your phone when driving and even make calls, but texting should be off limits. You have to look at your phone to long and take your eyes off the road which is extremely unsafe this should be reason enough not to do such things.\\n\\nIn conclusion, its simple to not text and drive because you're safer you could just listen to your music or if you really need to tell someone something you could just make a call to them instead and be a whole lot easier and safer.   \",\n",
       " 'Cell Phone Usage while Operating a Vehicle\\n\\nMany states have made the use of cell phones while driving illegal due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls and texting. Many states have also created laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Cell phone usage has become the leading cause of distracted driving. Drivers can easily become distracted, decreasing the driver\\'s awareness on the road, leading to more car accidents. I agree with cell phones being banned while driving.\\n\\nI believe that driving while using a cell phone should be banned because of the drastic increase in accidents. On one occasion, my mom was hit from behind because the person in the car behind her was texting on a cell phone. Fortunately my mom was not seriously hurt because the driver behind her was not driving at a high speed. If the driver in the car behind my mom was driving at a higher speed, my mom could have been severely injured or killed. Banning cell phone usage while driving enables a driver to remain focused and to keep the appropriate amount of distance between vehicles.\\n\\nA driver can\\'t focus on the road or other vehicles while consistently talking or texting on a cell phone. Studies have proven that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents.\\n\\nCell phone usage while driving has caused car insurance premiums to increase. My mom\\'s car insurance increased an additional $15 a month this year. That additional $15 can go towards gas to get us back and forth to school, work, church, etc. Her car insurance agent advised her that rates have increased across the board; distracted driving was the main reason for the increase. I earned my learner\\'s permit this year. My mom is afraid to teach me how to drive because of her fear of distracted driving. I will be attending a defensive driving school to learn how to drive. My mom is not looking forward to adding me as a driver on her car insurance because her premium is going to increase drastically.\\n\\nShe often complains about distracted driving contributing to higher car insurance rates. I don\\'t bother my mom about teaching me how to drive for now; she takes me wherever I need to go. I\\'m about to graduate from high school, and it is my intent to attend college or go to the military. I have to learn how to drive very soon, but I\\'m really not looking forward to it.\\n\\nSociety has become more connected to cell phones more than ever. Cell phones provide a lot of convenience. From communicating with relatives and friends, checking emails, paying bills, taking pictures, recording videos, listening to music; you name it! However, talking or texting on cell phones while driving simply don\\'t mix and has become a huge issue in the past few years.\\n\\nEverybody has their own opinion regarding cell phone usage while operating a vehicle, but I believe that using cell phones while driving should not be allowed. Using a cell phone while driving has the driver focusing on the phone instead of the road. This increases the time it takes for a driver to react effectively. In case of an emergency; the driver should pull over in a safe zone and then call for assistance. The main reason for most car accidents in today\\'s society is driving while using a cell phone.\\n\\nI urge my family, friends and anyone reading this essay to take the \"AT&T It Can Wait\" pledge against distracted driving at \"www. itcanwait. com\". \"Join the millions who have pledged to drive distraction free.\\n\\nFrom checking emails, to posting on social media behind the wheel, all of it can wait.\" As of today, over 32,083,847 pledges have been made. Pledge now!\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nWebsite: www. itcanwait. com Take the Pledge, Be an Advocate.                                                    ',\n",
       " 'Phones &Driving\\n\\nThere are three types of distractions, visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road, manual distractions are anything that causes you to take your hands off of your steering wheel, and cognitive distractions are anything that causes you to take your eyes off of the road. Throughout the years, over 3,447 people were killed by distracted drivers. Drivers 20 years old or younger are more susceptible to falling into the ring of distracted drivers. With today\\'s advanced social media platform a new and dangerous trend surfaced the web and went viral. The creators of the app \"Snapchat\" added a filter to the application that allows users to track their mph speed. This filter promotes distracted driving.\\n\\nAccording to the Washington Post, Christal McGee, an 18 year old, was behind the wheel of her father\\'s white Mercedes, on her way home from work on a Thursday night in September 2015, when she pulled out her phone and opened Snapchat. McGee wanted to try the filter out, so McGee, then accelerated some more, reaching 113 miles per hour on a suburban road outside Atlanta and the speed limit was 55. She didn\\'t see Maynard Wentworth, an Uber driver just starting his shift that night, until it was too late. She hit him at 107 miles per hour. Wentworth suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for months. McGee was sued and the infamous app was also sued for negligence.\\n\\nThe accidents and lives taken could have been easily prevented and still can. Drivers are encouraged every day to put their phones down when they drive to prevent accidents, but they do not take them seriously. A death of someone at the hands of a distracted driver could easily prevent many deaths. The choice of responding to a text message or saving someone\\'s life should be of no ignorance. As of July 1st, Georgia\\'s Hands Free Law was passed to keep cellphones out of people\\'s hands as they drive.\\n\\nIf drivers\\' hands and eyes are not on the road at all times because they choose to be distracted by a cellular device, then proper precautions should be taken to keep them off the road.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nMany humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.\\n\\nIn 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the \"hands-free\" law. This law doesn\\'t allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.\\n\\nAccording to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.\\n\\nWith this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.\\n\\nDeath is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else\\'s family.\\n\\nThis reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the \"hands-free\" law.\\n\\nIn the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the \"hands-free\" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it\\'s still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life\\'s unexpected turns.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I\\'m guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can \"arrive alive.\"                ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn today's society many phones have become an essential part of life. We use our phones everyday to talk, text, share pictures/ videos, and to use gps locaters. Although we are on our cell phones daily for various reasons there is a time and a place to use them. One time you should never use your cell phone is when operating a motor vehicle. The use of a cell phone can lead to many fatalities that can harm you or others.\\n\\nTexting while driving can be distracting, dangerous, and can lead to a accident. Picking up your phone for even a second means that your attention is not on the road and can lead to a fatal even deadly crash. Texting while driving is a manual, visual, and cognitive distraction. Taking one or more hand off the steering wheel is an example of an manual distraction and not having both hands on the wheel can lead to you not having complete control over the vehicle. Not having your eyes on the road is an example of a visual distraction and can lead to you crashing into something. Lastly, texting and driving is an example of a cognitive distraction because you are not focused on the road.\\n\\nTaking your eyes off the road can lead to a horrific accident that can cause harm to yourself or others. You should always be considerate of others around you whether its passengers in the car or pedestrians around you. Distracted driving means that while you aren't paying attention you could be crashing into someone and possibly taking their life. When looking down at your cell phone you aren't able to pay attention to what's going on around you nor will you be able to see a pedestrian. Will you be able to live with yourself knowing that you were the reason someone's life got taken away from them because of you?\\n\\nIn todays technology there are many alternatives to texting and driving. Cars now have wireless Bluetooth where you can answer the phone with a click of the button on your steering wheel. You can also speak your text messages so you don't have to look at your phone and divert your attention from the road. Even if you don't have a car with Bluetooth cell phones now come with a hands free feature and a do not disturb while driving feature. Manufactures are making it easier and easier to drive safely while also still being able to communicate effectively and efficiently with others.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting while driving can be extremely dangerous and should never be an option. It can lead to accidents and will distract you from the road. Once you take your eyes off the road you are not only putting yourself in danger but others too. There are too many new alternatives if you need you use your cell phone while driving therefore the percentages of deaths due to distracted drivers should not increase.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nDrivers should not use a phone unless they are using it as a navigational device to get to a destination. If used in any other way it is very dangerous and will cause serious accidents to them and other drivers as well. Driving while using cell phones cause major problems that could've been avoided if they weren't using a phone. According to statistics in 2018 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day have occured due to distracted driving\\n\\nOne problem that cell phones cause while driving are swerving off of roads while driving at high speeds. Swerving could cause other drivers to have accidents because they tried to avoid the person that was swerving. If they weren't on their phones that probably wouldn't have happened.\\n\\nAnother problem is self proclaimed accidents. Some reasons this happens is because the person was probably texting while driving and they took their eyes off the road. This is the most common problem that people have mostly among teen drivers. It is 6 times more likely to cause an accident if someone is texting and driving that driving under under the influence.\\n\\nPlaying video games on cell phones while driving is another problem because people often like to have some type of entertainment while driving. This could often cause road rage while they are driving because something probably happened and they got mad. Some app developers have started making video game apps that blocks a person out of the app while they are driving.\\n\\nAll of these problems that are caused by cell phones can be avoided if people use their cell phones wisely. Improper use of cell phones put their lives and other people's lives in danger. A cell phone should be used for specific reasons only if not then they should not be used at all.   \",\n",

Using your device while driving can endanger people's lives. People might make the excuse that they need to use their phone to use google maps but they could have done that before hand.

       " 'Cell Phones and Vehicles\\n\\nIn my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn\\'t be an issue anymore.\\n\\nHowever, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it\\'s not that easy for the police to catch them.\\n\\nWith bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it\\'s not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody\\'s life.\\n\\nWhat can stop drivers\\' using cell phones while driving?\\n\\nThe simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once \"Restriction on cell phones while driving\" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.\\n\\nI will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.

Many people think it's okay to use their phones while driving, but I personally think it is not okay for people to text and drive. Some people rather risk their life's than to be careful about their surrounding and how one car accident can cause so much damage all because that one person wanted to be on their phone. It doesn't just have to be texting it can be in general by just being on your phone. People get way too distracted by cellphone usage.\\n\\nCellphones make a big impact on people, who knew that cellphones can be that addicting. It doesn't matter where you are you turn your head and you see someone on their phone because it is so addicting. It almost like having a coffee addiction. When you see people crossing a cross walk you insatiately see a phone in someone's hands and half of the time there not looking at where there going they just walk and walk until they run into somethings. Cellphones are a huge addiction in today's society for everyone including teenagers. You see cellphones almost everywhere you going. You will be shocked about how many people use their phones a day.\\n\\nWhen you're driving and you're on your cellphone is really risky. It can cause many problems as in you cashing into someone else or you can go off the road and get in an accident. There have been many different accidents because people want to be on their phone and not focus on the road. Texting and driving can many deaths as well. People die of being in car accidents when the driver is texting. People don't look on the outside of how many tragic thinks can happen in a blink of an eye. It can be life changing too because you never know what can happen or go wrong. Many people don't know how much damage can happen. People die, vision lost, no arm, no leg, an arm, etc. none of this is replaceable but every material thing can be. That's what people don't understand. People need to be careful of their surroundings and, be careful who you have in the car.\\n\\nPeople have habits of looking at their phones once they hear a ring. They right away have to go see what it was or who it was. That's where the distraction comes from and that were people get into trouble with officers or car accidents etc. because they get distracted by the ring of a phone. There is always pros and cons about things people being on the phone. Some of the pros are if you have the sound on it is always good for important in the case of an emergency. You always have something on the side or if someone else calls you and it is an emergency. Some of the cons is that people use it for other purposes which is to text, snapchat, twitter, Instagram etc. and they think they can multi task but some people can't. That's why it's better to put the phone down and let social media wait before there is an accident.\\n\\nIt's better to save your life and some else's.\\n\\nBeing safe is one on the most important things. A text message or video call, snapchat, Instagram is not worth you in bad conditions or you causing a death to yourself or to someone else.

       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nI believe that despite the good that comes out of phones, they also have some serious cons when it comes to driving. 11 teens each day die due to using their phone. Not only are you risking your own life while operating a vehicle while texting, you're also putting other people's lives in danger. Using your phone while driving is a distraction no matter what the situation is. You also never know if the person in front of you could suddenly stop so having your phone out could lead to an unnecessary crash. There are a few reasons why cell phones shouldnt be used while driving. There are just so many dangerous things that could happen that are associated with the use of a cell phone and driving.\\n\\nDriving decreases the amount of attention you have on the road which increases the amount of crashes. If you are driving 60m/h your car is moving 16 meters per second, so just a few seconds that you dedicate looking at your phone could result in a serious crash. Just reaching for an object like your phone is just as dangerous. The act of a conversation is also still a distraction. The act of a conversation creates a depth of though which takes away from the attention you should have on the road.\\n\\nLuckily today we have things like apple carplay which you can use for urgent situations which reduces the amount of accidents. Over all, phones should not be used while operating a vehicle and if the situation is so urgent then it's safer to just pull over and take care of the situation. Doing that will reduce the amount of crashes each year. If we learn to prioritize the amount of things done while in a vehicle then it will save so many lives. We all need to understand the real dangers we put ourselves through along with other people while using our phones or any sort of technology while operating a vehicle.

Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don\\'t have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.\\n\\nHolding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver\\'s ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads \"ok\" isn\\'t worth a couple hundred dollar fine.\\n\\nHowever, people shouldn\\'t fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.   ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving Essay\\n\\nAll around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars.\\n\\nOne reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse.\\n\\nAnother reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol.\\n\\nHumans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough.\\n\\nIn conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk.   \",\n",

Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someone's life.\\n\\nThe average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything could've happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.\\n\\nBecause of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.\\n\\nThe states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later. Something needs to happen so that all of these deaths stop.         \",\n",
       " \"Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.\\n\\nWhile driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.\\n\\nWhen driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.\\n\\nBecause using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.\\n\\nMany accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the\\n\\nU.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving.\\n\\nCell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.   \",\n",
       " \"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.\\n\\nAnother reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.\\n\\nThere are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.\\n\\nSo it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.\\n\\nAnother good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.\\n\\nThese are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.         \",\n",

It's what gets us to and from our jobs. The downside to driving is that it is becoming unsafe. There are so many people in the world that dive cars and own cell phones. The population is growing which means more and more cars are hitting the road every day. So, the question is, how can we make driving safer?\\n\\nNew laws are being created on cell phones and driving. One of the familiar changes is that now you can't be touching your phone at all while driving and it can't be in your lap when driving. Some say they don't like this new law because it means they can't check their phones for emergencies. The law didn't say you couldn't keep it in the car or their glove department. So basically, that problem is solved. I think this Law is fine how it is and that it is a good law to cut down on cell phones and driving. People shouldn't be able to see their phone while driving. It should be somewhere in the car out of their eyesight. That way they won't be tempted to text while driving.\\n\\nTexting and driving can get both people killed that crash into each other.\\n\\nYou could be driving and doing nothing wrong while another person is texting and driving not paying attention to the road and they could end up ending your life.\\n\\nTexting is not the only problem with having a cell phone on you when you are in a car. Some people say they use their phone for navigation. This could also be a distraction. Many phone companies have touched down on this problem. In fact, the newer model phones now can speak the directions to you while you're driving. That way you won't have to look down at your phone.\\n\\nPeople often like to bring up that sometimes they get important calls while driving. There's also a solution to this problem to. When you are receiving a call, you can pull over to the nearest stop and then receive the call. People then like to ask what if you are on the interstate. There is no law that says you can't pull over to the side and make or receive the phone call. So, yea you should be able to use your phones while driving but keep note there is a right and wrong way of doing this. If you need to use it and you just happen to be driving, please use these techniques to drive safer.   \",\n",
       " 'Ever since phones have entered into the world, it has since then become a part of a person\\'s everyday life. With such an important impact that helps what people do in all fields of work, it is no surprise that people use phones wherever they go. Another important inclusion in a person\\'s everyday life is a car, which is also used by people everyday, though cars have proven to be a lot more dangerous than a phone if a person is not paying attention to the road. Many accidents have happened as a result of people not paying attention to the road and this is exactly where a phone comes into play. As previously mentioned, phones are a part of a person\\'s everyday life, and with that much involvement with a phone it often tends to follow people to them while they are driving their car. When people are on their phone while driving, their chances of getting into an accident greatly increase. Though it may seem harmless at first, operating a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should not be allowed.\\n\\n\"Car crashes happen every minute of the day\", according to the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). According to Teensafe, \"Distracted driving accounts for approximately is 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities...58% being teens.\" Ironically, teens use phones more than adults as they are more involved with social media websites and apps. Teens, unlike adults, are also more inexperienced at driving, making the act of them using phones even more dangerous than adults. With all the things that people have to pay attention to on the road, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time.\\n\\n\"Sending or reading a text causes drivers, on average, to take their eyes off the road for five seconds,\" according to Teenlife. Anything can happen in one second when a person\\'s eyes are not on the road, imagine what could happen in five. Whenever a person uses their phone, their chance of being in a crash increases by twenty-three. There are three types of distracted driving and texting fits all three types which is visual, manual, and cognitive. Using a phone causes a person to take their eyes of the road, take their hands off the wheel, and to take their mind off of the road. Because texting can become all three types of distractions, it\\'s arguably the most dangerous action to participate in while driving.\\n\\nOnce again, phones have become a major part of the human life, and as a result, people constantly use their phones. Whether it is to check a text or watch a quick video, it is very dangerous to even attempt this while in a car. Operating a phone or any brand or size should not be allowed while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while not driving is not safe and has proven to be deadly. Hopefully, people will learn not to text and drive and be safer on the road.         ',\n",

Crashing your vehicle not only increases your car insurance, you then also have to pay to get the car fixed! Not only are you risking your life and the lives of those around you, you are also quite literally forcing yourself to pay the price for making the mistake of texting and driving. All in all, driving while operating a phone should be discouraged, because it endangers the lives, it's illegal, and it impairs judgement.\\n\\nWhen you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of passengers, pedestrians, and yourself along with fellow drivers. The damage that's caused from a single glance can be irreversible. Some physical effects the driver, passenger, or pedestrian may sustain are cuts, burns, bone fractures, and internal organ damage. The physical effects can be very traumatic, but not nearly as traumatic as the psychological effects. Although not visible to the eye, the psychological effects of a car accident can interfere with a person's daily life. The individual may experience anxiety, depression, behavioral changes, and PTSD(www. askadamskutner. com). These make simple task such as driving, socializing, and sleeping seemingly impossible, which can last a lifetime.\\n\\nTexting while driving is strictly prohibited in 47 states and could get you in trouble with the law(www. drivewithsentinel. com). Although the conditions vary in each state, the consequences are by far very unpleasant. The driver will be obligated to pay monetary fines ranging from 20 to 500 dollars depending on state. If the offense results in the injury or death of an innocent live, the driver may face time behind bars. Repeated offenses for texting and driving will escalate into additional consequences, this includes points on one's driving record, revocation of driving privileges, mandatory road safety classes, and vehicle impoundment(www. legalmatch. com). The violations you committed will remain in your personal record and ruin your odds of obtaining a promising job.\\n\\nIn this modern era, the popularity of mobile devices cause impairment to one's judgement while driving.\\n\\nAs adolescents become more reliant on technology, so does their strong need to multitask as well. Many believe multitasking benefits one to become more efficient and accomplish more tasks. Although this sounds good in theory, the outcome can produce multiple errors. The constant shift of attention causes drivers to keep their eyes off the road, which leads to constant pullovers. In addition, the driver can exceed the speed limit and not be able to see stop signs or traffic lights. This will lead the driver into an unwanted accident and cause confusion and delay among drivers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, one should not text while driving because it jeopardizes the lives of others, it will get you in trouble with the law, and impairs one's judgment. Such reckless behavior will only make the driver feel nothing but everlasting guilt and regret.      \",\n",

We live in an age when many of us are excited by a call or text that we can't wait to answer. Texting while driving is a hotly debated topic that often divides opinion. It goes without saying that driving with a mobile phone is one of the most important issues facing us today. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument.\\n\\nTo start with our population on reasons why accidents happen are because of cell phones. First of all, it is worth considering that phones shouldn't be allowed on peoples hands while driving. Secondly drivers must have their phones on a phone holder to prevent getting pulled over and prevent an accident. Thirdly you must be focused while driving if you have passengers on board because you're putting their lives at risk. Therefore you shouldnt be holding your phone.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is not just your cell phone but anything that distracts you like food, advertisements etc, can cause an accident. Last but not least that text or call can wait.\\n\\nAccording to experts, more than 3,000 teens die to texting while driving. Research has found that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk drivers. There are those who argue that phones should be allowed while driving. For example if an emergency occurs and someone is trying to get a hold of you, you would need your cell phone to stay in contact. Another example is if you are lost you can call someone for directions. There is always a solution to everything like having a car holder and putting gps rather than calling someone.\\n\\nAlthough most drivers are in the age of driving, teens aren't supposed too. Teens have led to one of the reasons accidents happen. Despite the fact that they aren't supposed to be driving they are very irresponsible. On the other hand, adults are supposed to teach their kids the right way to drive, to always drive focus never look at other accidents deals in the street while driving always look ahead. However teens should drive with an adult past 7 pm.\\n\\nAs far as im concerned, we should always drive with a phone holder to prevent an accident. From my point of view accidents happen due to several other reasons but mostly because of our phones. Weighing both sides of the argument people have their own opinion on whether or not cells are distracting. My opinion about cell phones while driving is very dangerous, we shouldn't be allowed to grab our phones while driving. Now in georgia it's illegal to hold your phone, part of a sweeping hands-free law. Also to be careful on the road, you might run someone ever, you never know cause most people j walk.

       " 'Phones and driving\\n\\nOver the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time. Resulting in two of many of society\\'s most used technology; automobiles and cell phones. Cell Phones were created to make communication a lot easier, as well as mobile. So that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point. With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.\\n\\nIn order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. \"In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving.\" \"Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents. In that same year, distracted driving was cited as a major factor in 3,477 traffic deaths.\" These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.\\n\\nWhile using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.\\n\\nOverall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver\\'s life. All phone calls, text messages, and photos can be answered and liked once the destination has been reached. It is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.         ',\n",

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nThe first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become pretty lousy. Examples of this are shown in various ways such as someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into an adjacent lane, the driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slows down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road, which is one of the most common ways to end up in an auto crash. No text message or phone call is worth a rude action on a highway or city road much less an auto accident. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car merge into a lane, pull out in front of another vehicle, slow down, and for a few other reasons too.\\n\\nThe next reason why it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive is because committing these actions causes more automobile crashes, as my other discussions have already indicated. Why is this? It is because using a cell phone while driving distracts the driver causing him/her to look elsewhere. Some may be attempting to dial, text, or talking on their cell phone, but nevertheless it still distracts the driver. Because of this distraction, drivers are more prone to end up in an automobile accident. Just as if a distraction might cause you to lose a point in a tennis match, a distraction on the road could cause an automobile accident. Another reason why not to use a cell phone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are less dangerous. For example, the earpiece is a device that fits on your outer ear as you might have guessed and allows you to have both hands on the steering wheel while you answer a call. With the push of a button, a call can be answered while you can still be driving safely. In conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important? The text message or your life?. If you are pulled over texting and driving, you will be issued a fine. However, if you are texting and driving and you cause an accident, there may be criminal consequences for those actions that could result in jail time. Nowadays, there are many apps available to drivers to deter them from texting while driving Something very important is that many of the states have started to pass some laws that order drivers to stop texting while driving. However, we need to be sincere: none of these laws will be effective if we as a society don't understand that texting while driving could have terrible consequences, not only for us as drivers but also for other innocent people. I don't think that answering texts is more important than the lives of other people; texting can wait until drivers arrive at their destination.   \",\n",

Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three. Look for your cars manual and it should have directions on how to set up bluetooth from your phone to your car. I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving. You will only have to set up bluetooth once, so once your phone is paired there is no undoing it unless you please.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I don't think people should be allowed to use cell phones in their vehicle to any extent if it's unavoidable. People who do so not only are putting themselves at risk but other people's lives as well. Bluetooth is a great alternative to minimize the use of cell phones while operating vehicles.

       " 'Cell Phone Drivers\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans in the world own and use cell phones everyday, however no person should be allowed to use their cellular device while operating a vehicle. These vehicles include trucks, sedans, vans, heavy machinery vehicles, bikes, etc. The use of a cellular device while operating a vehicle serves as a major distraction to the driver; even if the driver only looked at the phone just a second could call for a fatal result. Thousands of people die every year due to cell phone use while operating a vehicle, however fatalities, as such, could easily be avoided if drivers would wait until they\\'re no longer driving to check their phones. Texting and driving can be as dangerous as driving intoxicated, driving under the influence, for you reaction time is weakened due to the distraction of your phone. A good reason to not text while driving would be that it takes only a few seconds to park your car, if looking at your phone is that important. With how today\\'s cellphones are made to draw the user in, it is imperative that drivers make the smart decision to just wait to use their phones.\\n\\nWhen texting while driving, you are more likely to end up in a wreck rather than going about your day. According to https://www. netsafeutah. org/teens/staysafe/distracted_driving. html , \"Drivers on the phone have worse reaction times than many drunk drivers.\" this is important because when you look at your phone while driving is like the equivalent to driving with a blind fold on, and the time it takes the driver to look back at the road from looking at their phone is the same amount of time that it would take to take the \"blindfold\" off. According to https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving,\\n\\n\"Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that\\'s like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.\" It only take five seconds of a distraction mistake to result in something that can catastrophically change your life forever, and not in a good way! In all consideration, as a driver, if there is a high need to be on the phone just pull the car over. Although it only takes five seconds of distraction to end in a crash, it takes just a few seconds to pull over safely.\\n\\nWhy risk the consequences of using a phone while driving to begin with? Although the results of using a phone while driving may very, the odds still are not in your favor! As the driver you not only risk your own life, but you also put other lives in your vicinity at risk. According to Jim Forsyth, a Reuters reporter, \"The typical reaction time without texting was between one and two seconds, but while texting it increased to three to four seconds, regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text.\" (https://www. abc. net. au/science/articles/2011/10/06/3333955. htm). When it comes to driving reacting and timing is everything, but when a driver gets distracted it is almost inevitable for something bad to happen. When driving there is already so much happening on the road, so much that there\\'s not much room for error, that those two seconds of reaction time are key to preventing a car crash. There are so many rules and laws to driving a motor vehicle, however the easiest, of all the rules and laws, is to not text while driving. In fact if a driver always follow this rule, they could be considered a superhero for all the lives they save by not putting others at risk because they did not text and drive.\\n\\nIs texting and driving at the same time dangerous? One must not have a brain to think there are no risks to texting and driving. Sure, everyone has done it, so why not? Everytime a person texts and drives, they put themselves and others on the road in danger of ending in a car accident or worse death. Don\\'t text and drive, because doing this you will save lives!     ',\n",
       " 'The majority of people own and use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of this usage is done while said people are driving. While using a phone and driving is common, it can also be very dangerous. That is why people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are other reasons why phone usage should not be permitted while a person is driving.\\n\\nOne of the reasons a person should not be allowed to use their phone while driving is that the risk of getting into a car crash is raised. Those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be in a car crash than those who do not text and drive. In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. Many states ban the use of phones behind the wheel for this reason. If people did not use their phone behind the wheel, the number of deaths and injuries would drop drastically.\\n\\nThe states that prohibit cell phone usage behind the wheel are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. In Georgia, drivers are not allowed to touch any kind of electronic device with any part of their body. This law has been put into effect because of the more than 1,500 deaths from distracted driving in Georgia in 2016.\\n\\nPeople should not be able to use their phones while driving. The use of phones behind the wheel puts many lives at risk. Many states have already banned the use of phones behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe rest of the United States should create new laws to prohibit the use of phones behind the wheel as well.   ',\n",
       " 'Consequences for texting and driving.\\n\\nIn recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn\\'t use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren\\'t considering other motorists. If you\\'re too busy texting or talking you become distracted and you aren\\'t concentrated on the road anymore. So many car accidents are caused by texting and driving. According to Georgia\\'s driving statistics there are 3287 deaths each day from distracted driving. Texting and driving is illegal in the state of Georgia. On July 1st 2018 they made a law and it says \"all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state is prohibited from holding or supporting...\" you know it\\'s a pretty serious situation if the entire state of Georgia made a law about it.\\n\\nTexting and driving also set bad examples for kids and other people. Often when you are operating a vehicle you have other passengers like young kids and teenagers. You don\\'t want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that\\'s the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else.\\n\\nDid you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A&M transportation conducted a \"how your reaction time is affected\" project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you\\'re texting and driving the reaction time number shoots up to four or five seconds. You may think \"oh whatever four to five\" seconds isn\\'t enough time to cause any damage\" and in reality, if you\\'re not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can\\'t keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can\\'t reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can\\'t get to it.\\n\\nNow think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free. I think in order to prevent all these accidents among teens especially is to have cars that blocks out service so that phone access is completely impossible! Now that you\\'ve read this will you change, or will you continue to make the same careless decisions? Texting and driving accident percentages can go down if we all try to stop. People are dying and getting seriously injured because of that. Today let\\'s make a promise that we will put the phones down and travel safe!                     ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nOver the last few years there have been many records of death and/or Injury from being on your phone and driving. There are many laws in place to stop this act from happening, but just like with everything else, there\\'s no way to fully stop it. Many people have different opinions on the subject. In this essay I will be explaining the two sides; good and the bad. How dangerous is it to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time?\\n\\nSix thousand people die each year in the US due to texting and driving. Cell phone use should be prohibited why you operate any piece of machinery. Things malfunction and can go wrong with your full attention on them. Don\\'t give any room for error. You aren\\'t only putting yourself into danger but everyone else around you as well. Anything you do besides watching the road and focusing on your surroundings is putting your life at risk. Anything can happen in two seconds without your eyes on the road. Think about how many times you almost got into an accident due to someone else not paying attention, but you\\'re fine because you were. A phone takes that away from you.\\n\\nThere\\'s not a good side to texting and driving. They\\'ve made many alternatives to not having to touch your phone while driving but still being able to operate it. We all have a virtual human on our phones who tells us directions or calls who we want based on us saying things like, \"Hey Siri.\" They make phone holders for your dash, but that\\'s sill dangerous because you shouldn\\'t take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion. Everyone uses a cellphone while driving because they feel like they must be in a rush to get a text sent or etc. It isn\\'t safe to be distracted by anything while driving let alone something so addicting already like a cellphone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, trying to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time is dangerous and life threatening. It takes one second to not be in an accident because you were too late. Just one second could change so many lives, and impact many more. You should stay focused on the road and arriving to your destination. That one missed phone call can be returned, and if not pull over somewhere safely and stay parked until you\\'re done messing with your phone. Don\\'t operate a phone and drive. The road requires your full attention.   ',\n",
       " 'Today many people are on their phone & driving at the same time. Cell phone use while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries have been occurred from accidents caused by texting and driving. In my opinion, driving without phone use will decrease the percent of crashes around the world. Phone use is one of the reasons of car crashes occurring.\\n\\nAnswering a text takes at least 5 seconds of your attention away. That can be enough time for you to collide into another car or a car colliding into you. Even answering a call could take most of your distraction away from you seeing where you are driving. It would be safer to use the cell phone when you come to a complete stop or when you have reached your destination.\\n\\n94% of teens that drive acknowledge the danger there can be by texting and driving, but 35% admit to doing it anyway. Teens are a big percent more likely than adults to get into a car crash or almost crashing into another car or anything that is in your path due to talking or texting on the cell phone. Also the amount of teen passengers doubles the risk of car crashes, because they are young & they like to use cell phones. They are even more of a distraction with all of the hype & noises.\\n\\n263 teens (age 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016. The rate has increased throughout the years. If you can wait until you come into a complete stop or if you can wait until you reach your destination, please do so, because it will decrease the risk of crashes around the world.      ',\n",
       " 'Should Drivers use Cell phones while driving?\\n\\nWhat would we do without the latest technologies in our daily life? We use computers for work and in school, we use cell phones to access apps and do research. At home, we use microwaves to heat up food and landlines have been replaced by cell phones as the main phone of many people. In our daily lives we use cell phones to text, look up boarding passes, check flights and make phone calls. More and more, people are using technology, including cell phones, as an important part of their lives. As more and more people become dependent on the use of cell phones, some of the time they are being used may be in a car, while driving. Is the cell phone more helpful or hurtful when they are used by drivers in a car?\\n\\nWhile a small minority of people do not have cell phones, the prevalence of cell phone ownership and use has increased. \"Cell phone usage is becoming a mounting issue in the United States with 91% of Americans (97% of people between 18-24) owning cell phones and using them for texting, calling and communicating for personal, work and school in daily life.\" (\"Cell Phone ownership\"). Cell phones are so in trend with their convenience and popularity they seem to be increasing in numbers and not decreasing. \"Eighty-one percent of Americans own smart phones up from 35% in the 2011\" (\"Mobile Fact Sheet\"). It seems that more people are becoming dependent on them, despite the potential risks. For teens, texting has become more popular as making a phone call. Starting in the year 2001, State governments have started creating laws to limit cell phone usage by individuals driving in cars, as risks arise.\\n\\nDespite the controversy there are benefits of cellphones especially for teenage students, who are now using new technologies during the school year. Cell phones are becoming more popular in school as a learning aid. \"In a recent poll 94% of students use their phones in class for learning\" (\"Cell phone use\"). The Majority of U.S. students are now relying on cell phones to get their school assignments and homework done. Since these teens have the cell phones in their possession, as they drive to school, they may be tempted to use them, both texting and calling, while they are behind the wheel. The benefits of this immediate communication with others and the convenience it creates, it may be outweighed by the risks and dangers of this usage.\\n\\nIn contrast to the benefits for cell phones, the dangers of distracted driving are real. Starting in the 2000\\'s, States have started to restrict the use of cell phones while driving mainly due to the incidence of car accidents involving a driver using their cell phone. The fatalities do not just include the driver, but also the passengers and other victims. \"Twenty states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have hand-held cell phone use bans and thirty-eight states ban all cell phone use by novice and teen drivers\" (\"Distracted Driving Laws\"). \"Cell phone use while driving causing distracted driving has been linked to automobile accidents and fatalities\". (\"Distracted Driving Laws\"). The increase in accidents associated with cell phones is still controversial and there are arguments on both sides as far as the causes.\\n\\nSome surprising emerging data shows a benefit of cell phones is their use in emergency situations. \"Patients are more likely to survive when emergency services are called from a cell phone rather than a landline\" (Weinlich). \"It is associated with improved mortality rates at the scene of medical events\" (\"Mobile Phones proven\"). Drivers may use their cell phones while driving to report an emergency. As more people continue to use cell phones more people may be able to helped and potentially saved in emergencies. Is the risk of distracted driving worth the potential benefit of helping someone in distress?\\n\\nIn addition to the risk associated with distracted driving there is another health risk associated with phone use. \"Cell phones give off a form of energy known as radiofrequency (RF) waves.\" (\"Cell Phone Safety\"). And while this risk occurs whether the person is driving or not, it would be another reason for the driver to adhere to the handsfree laws. The concern has been a link that shows increasing risk of brain tumors of the head and neck while the driver holds the phone to the face (Creagan). \"The evidence is mixed though and there is limited evidence linking cell phone radiation to human cancer\" (\"Electromagnetic Fields\"). The mounting risks and seeming benefits for the driver are numerous and careful consideration must be used when considering using a cell phone while driving.\\n\\nOverall phones have changed society for the better and for the worse. Since their introduction, the cell phone has significantly changed how people talk and has increased the convenience of personal communication. But the life-changing benefits of the cell phone come with many controversial risks. The negative effects of deaths from distracted driving along with other health concerns cannot be overlooked. Many distracted cell phone driver accidents occur with young teenage drivers actively using their cellphones while operating a motor vehicle. While these events may make the evening news, they will never bring back the special life of that driver, the passengers or others that may have been hurt or killed. More private and government agencies need to further expose the dangerous links of driver cell phone use to human health. There is a great need to further educate the public of these risks. Having these agencies along with Hollywood, TV and social media, where images and messaging catch teens attention, could positively educate drivers and shape what safe cellphone usage looks like. This positive action may ultimately save lives.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Cell phone ownership\". Pew Research Today, 6 June 2013 pewresearch. org/fact-tank.

       " 'Phone & Driving\\n\\nIt has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.\\n\\nBeing on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.\\n\\nAnother cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.\\n\\nFinally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.\\n\\nTo sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                        ',\n",
       " '. Phones & Driving\\n\\nWhile using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.\\n\\nObviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.\\n\\nTexting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.\\n\\nNow onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who\\'s near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone\\'s poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every \"texting while driving\" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.   ',\n",
       " \"Texting and driving\\n\\nThe use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others, playing games, and using the many different internet based features.\\n\\nWe use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good . According to https://www. insurancejournal. com/news/national/2018/08/24/499107. htm\\n\\nThe death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. Texting and driving should not be aloud because it can kill people and its bad that it happens . People have lost their lives because of a text which is sad one moment your here next you're not you could be driving one day and text while driving with a blink of an eye you could be gone .\\n\\nThe laws and punishment the law should be to not be on your cell phone while driving or if you're are on it make sure it's on speaker phone or have somebody text on your phone to whoever. The punishment should be a fine or community service but no serious punishment because it was an accident . But if it was on purpose then should have jail time why because it was done intentionally and they knew exactly what they were doing . It's a accident most of the time but the point is that it happens which we can't prevent car accidents but we can decrease them.\\n\\nAnd for coverage for your car like insurance cost sometimes a lot of money it really depends on the insurance company and the benefits from that company . but it's worth it and don't text and drive it may cost you a lot of money or your life it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into .We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention . We also have cameras to catch these things that cause accidents and they work most of the time but doesn't reduce accidents .

For the rest of your life you will have to deal with that pain and constant flash backs.\\n\\nI personally don't believe that people should be able to use there phone while operating a motor vehicle . The average percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were they were distracted by their cell phones is 21% . Even though that's not a high percent it's alot of hurt for the parents victim and the driver of that vehicle cause not only are you putting your sure in danger you putting that victim at risk of loosing there life to. The average percent of kid's and adults admitting they still text and drive is 35% that mean over 35% of kids around the world is texting and driving everyday putting their life and our life in jeopardy to.\\n\\nIn Conclusion tell me do you think texting and driving should be legal or illegal ...make sure you think about it hard cause next time it could be you or someone you know. Always check the facts and let someone know they could end their life by just one stupid mistake .

Most people lives are taken each and every day by a simple act called \"Careless Driving\". The act of texting and has come across from this new generation.\\n\\nStatistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341000 involved text messaging.\\n\\nTexting while driving is worse than talking while driving. Talking while driving isn\\'t as bad because your focused on the road but at the same time, you\\'re trying to listen to someone else\\'s conversation, and you try to get over and you think your focused and you\\'re not then boom a car crash. Texting while driving as to be the worst thing ever and causes more effects and injuries. Texting while driving you have look down at your phone instead of it being in front of you the boom when you rise back up to see the road, you\\'re on the other side of or about to hit a car.\\n\\nStatistics show that 37,461 lives were lost on U.S roads in 2016 an increase of 5.6% from 2015 until 2017. Also, in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. So, it seems that texting while driving is way dangerous then talking while driving its many proving facts you get kilt faster while texting and driving.\\n\\nThey have cars today that can stop people from having cellphones in their hand.

       " \"The use of cellphones today has increased dramatically over time almost everyone owns a cellular device and has become addicted to being on it. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing a raise to people's insurance, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year caused by from by texting. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving while using a cell phone while drunk and driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.\\n\\nBecause of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.   \",\n",

If you are operating a vehicle, your attention should always be on the road. Although many teens are getting blamed for texting and driving, many adults do it too. Texting and driving has caused many deaths over the last couple of years in the U.S. Most of today's car crashes are due to texting and driving.\\n\\nIt's very important to not text and drive. To begin, it's very dangerous and can cause a lot of problems, including accidents. However, texting and driving is not the only thing that causes accidents. If you're talking on the phone while driving, that can be a big problem as well. When talking on the phone, you can get distracted easily. Driver's need to focus on driving and not be distracted by phones or any other electronic devices.\\n\\nAnother reason you should not operate a phone while driving is because you may harm yourself or others. Small children could be in the car and drivers should be aware of such precious cargo. Children are most vulnerable when it comes to car crashes. That's why it's very important to be mindful about texting and driving. Young kids die every day because of careless drivers.\\n\\nIn closure, the main reason why you shouldn't text and drive is because other people's lives are at stake. Many people don't understand how dangerous using an electronic device while operating a vehicle can be. Texting and driving can be harmful and fatal.

No one should be allowed to drive and be on their phone at the same time. People should be focusing on the road and not their phone because it's dangerous for other drivers on the road and themselves. There are many accidents that happen just because someone isn't paying attention to the road.\\n\\nPhones shouldn't be allowed on the road as someone is driving because it can be dangerous for people that walk and can cause uncertain deaths.\\n\\nMany people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going. Another life gone down the drain all because a driver paid more attention to their phone than the road.\\n\\nDrivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.\\n\\nPhones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone. In other words, no one should use their phones while they're driving because of the horrible damage it could do to someone else.   \",\n",
       " \"A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone.\\n\\nIn America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied.\\n\\nIn 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash.\\n\\nA lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones.\\n\\nIn conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. There is just too much at risk to be driving distracted.   \",\n",

We use it when we walk, eat, etc. But most dangerously when we are driving. Our phones cause a big distraction that we do not pay attention to anything we do. Using our phones while we drive can lead to small, big, or even fatal accidents. Not just on the driver, but also anyone who is nearby. According to Edgar Snyder, approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phones while behind the wheel. In fact, using our phones and driving is the leading cause of death for teenagers today. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur every year because of accidents caused by using our phones and driving.\\n\\nAfter numerous accidents and injuries, most teenagers are pledging not to text and drive. The percentage of injuries involving the subject has dropped and is still dropping. Teenagers and other people have been spreading awareness to prevent any more car injuries involving phones.

It is even harder to avoid using your cellphone while driving unless you put your phone on do not disturb while you\\'re driving but even doing that there is very little that you can do to avoid people calling and distracting drivers from the road. Using your phone while driving also leads to many car accidents because people just aren\\'t paying attention to the road. Driving and using phones can cause death , is hindering children\\'s lives,and how we can prevent death in our society,\\n\\nThe death rate has gone up because \"263 teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016\" at least half of teen deaths in motor vehicles among young people are related to using cell phones while driving .This is becoming a very serious matter and may be affecting someone close to you.\\n\\nThe national safety council of the united states of america said that\"cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". Car accidents can lead to deaths and also brain cell lossage these things can and will affect the futures of people who are involved in them. A way to lower these numbers would be by closely monitoring your own and the people who are around you cell phone usage while driving and always speak up when you see people doing it.\\n\\ncell phone use while driving has gotten out of hand because of the increased popularity of use in technology. It has become a bigger issue because people who do it believe driving and using their phone is ok and no one will catch them, and do not take it as a serious issue. That is why it has gotten out of control because people think of it as a law that can be broken and it is nowhere near that.\\n\\nIf Driving and using phones was to be taken more serious less crashes would happen.\\n\\nWithout people speaking up driving and using cellphones will only continue to happen if we don\\'t apply these better ways to prevent it. cell phone use while driving is a very serious issue and should be taught to more of our youth so that accidents can be lowered and we can live in peace. because Driving and using phones is not ok, and drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

       " 'Distractive driving\\n\\nTwo seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices.\\n\\nMultitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, \"Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that\\'s one out of every four car accidents!\"(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver\\'s perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the \"Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia\" states, \"In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States.\" (Distracted Driving Research)\\n\\nAll driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily\\'s article states, \"Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone.\" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers\\' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims.\\n\\nDrivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people\\'s lives.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nDelbridge, Emily. \"Are You Paying Higher Car Insurance Because of the Texting Epidemic?\" The Balance, The Balance, 13 June 2019, https://www. thebalance. com/how-texting-and-driving-push-insurance-rates-up-4163808.\\n\\n\"Distracted Driving Research.\" Center for Injury Research and Prevention, 7 Nov. 2018, https://injury. research. chop. edu/teen-driving-safety/distracted-driving-research#.Xe_nJ-hKjHo.\\n\\nWallington 3            ',\n",

However a big problem and debate that everyone has is whether or not they should be aloud for use while driving. They can take your focus off of the task at hand which could be dangerous. However I believe that they should be allowed for use while driving.\\n\\nIn the car, a cell phone can be very useful. One big thing it is used for is maps. You can use your cell phone to look up your destination. Without the use of your maps you could get lost around town. Or stuck somewhere that you do not want to be. This could see to be dangerous so your cell phone could help you.\\n\\nAnother reason I personally believe they should be used is for music. I do not believe I could find many people to agree with me on this one if I am being honest. However, the music is very important to some people and it can help concentration while driving. It can keep you awake if you are tired. I think it is safe, as long as you just shuffle a playlist and do not stay looking at your phone to change songs.\\n\\nCell phones all around can be very helpful when it comes to driving. They can help your focus with music so you're not falling asleep behind the wheel. They can also help you not get lost in the middle of nowhere. So as long as you are safe and aware I think cell phones can be beneficial to driving.       \",\n",

With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIf you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger.

Honestly though, I believe that people shouldn\\'t use their phones while driving because it has more cons than pros.\\n\\nBeing on the phone while driving has many reasons. Maybe you have to communicate to someone because its urgent and you don\\'t have the time to wait till you\\'re done driving. Sometimes you are talking to someone over the phone or through text because you find it more convenient and private in your own car. Or maybe you just feel like scrolling through social media because you\\'re bored. It might save time if your running late to places and it might be easy for people. They might think the accidents could never happen to them because they are too good of drivers.\\n\\nThe truth is that If you think texting in an emergency situation is ok but it will end up causing another problem on top of what\\'s going on if you get into an accident just because you needed to make the call or send the message for an emergency.\\n\\nEach year over 330,000 accidents caused by texting while driving lead to severe injuries according to \"Spivey law firm. com\".\\n\\nabout 9 people are killed every day and over 1,000 injured because of distracted drivers on their phones. Texting while driving is the leading cause of teen deaths in these past years. \"DMV.org\" can prove all of my statements and statistics to be true.\\n\\nTexting while driving also has legal repercussions, in 47 states out of the 50 it is illegal to text and drive. you can get fined for about $125 for just your first offence. If you don\\'t think paying that much for one ticket is far well also note that because of that you will have an increase in insurance payments. You can also get your license suspended and won\\'t be able to even drive till they give it back. In some cases, you can even end up in prison for it. Is sending a meme worth possible jail time? It is best to just break the bad habit. It will make you drive better because no distractions and you don\\'t have to worry about the cops pulling you over or anything like that. It will leave you more relaxed at the end of the day.\\n\\nBeing on your phone while driving is done all the time and can\\'t be completely stopped but it should honestly be stopped all together. The risk and the problems are way more and way worse than the benefits of using it. It ends up getting you in trouble, having to pay fines and can cause serious sometimes fatal consequences.

Everyone has to pay attention to the road just like you will have to. It can cause you to swerve; stop on brakes to hard, not pay attention to your surroundings, and last but you least it will cause a wreck. You can put others in dangers from your use to the road.\\n\\nHaving 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards. Looking forward is the way to go because if you keep looking at what\\'s beside you and behind you will cause a lot of commotion in traffic. If that can cause commotion imagine what looking down at your cell phone can do and what trouble it can put you in.\\n\\nExplaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what\\'s in front of you. More importantly is your life and you staying alive. If you need your GPS to get somewhere its best you buy a phone holder to hold the phone up on your window or just buy a GPS from a nearby store.\\n\\nIn conclusion, stay off your phone! It\\'s a trend now not only to you but to the whole world. It\\'s impossible to do 2 things at one time while you control a steering wheel. You can take innocent lives fin a matter of seconds for a message or phone call that could have waited. If texting or being on the phone is more important just pull over.                                   ',\n",
       " \"Should people who are driving be able to use cell phones while they drive? I strongly disagree, as there are new teens driving everyday. Teens tend to use their phones a lot and they probably haven't been driving as much as some adults. Regardless of how long you have been driving i personally think you should not be texting and driving, or doing anything with your phone. Teens are probably the people who cause most of the crashes due to them texting and driving or not focusing on the road.\\n\\nMost teens take driving as if they were in a video game. I believe they use this thought process because in some video games you tend to do reckless driving and i think some teens take that idea. I personally think that ever since smart phones came out the car crash rates have gone up extremely. This is due to the egear of wanting to use your cellular device. I don't think we can stop texting and driving because most people do it and then act innocent when they see a police car near them. I know this from experience.\\n\\nI disagree with this because people's lives are in danger with just a swipe or just writing a 3 letter text. You keep your eyes off the road which means anything can happen in the slightest second. I think there should be some type of app that you have to use in order to turn your car on, which then locks your phone until the car is off or you have reached your destination. Texting and driving is a serious cause and teens & adults should take this more seriously so they can risk not getting into an accident.      \",\n",
       " \"Cell Phones and Driving\\n\\nShould you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!!\\n\\nTo begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text.\\n\\nAnother reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom?\\n\\nMore so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved?\\n\\nAlso it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI.\\n\\nA third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle.\\n\\nBeing able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.                  \",\n",
       " \"Driving is fun of course, making plans with your friends, going out, having fun but it can also impact your life because this world isn't perfect and there could be worst times in your life or better days. It could be times were you crash or get stopped.\\n\\nSo in my honest opinion humans shouldn't be using cells phones when they are driving because it could cause a big accident and can even risk taking their own life. Many people drive and text and their so entertain with their phone that they don't keep up with the road and sometimes lose control of the wheel.\\n\\nNot only do people use their phone but they wonder off to space or some are too busy looking at cars or doing their makeup. So it is wrong to use your phone while you in the car driving it can do major stuff you can even get stopped by the police by texting and driving. People should be more careful on driving. You might not sometimes take your own life but you can take other people life by doing a major crash. So people who are so addict with their phones shouldn't be driving for many reasons. And should let someone else drive.\\n\\nLike phones can ruined so much in society and can cause a lot of damage. So I am very against on using phones while driving. It's like most of the drivers I seen are on their phone and don't see when a green light or red is on or when there's stop texting and paying attention to the road or you just don't care signs or any other kind of signs. So it's either you save your life by not driving and keep having your eyes off the road and do a major impact and crash.\\n\\nIn conclusion, overall driving and texting is bad. So yes, in my opinion I think you should save your calls and messages for later and pay attention to the road so you can get safely to your destination and be glad nothing happened on the road because anything can happen in a heartbeat.   \",\n",

We can perform any task on a cell phone. 91 percent of American adults own some type of cell device. It is a proven fact that a large number of fatalities and injury in vehicle crashes are due to using the cell phone while driving. The state of Georgia passed a handsfree act that took effect on July 1, 2018. Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any other body part while driving. Texting while driving is bad and dangerous for you and other drivers. If you take your eyes off the road for a split second you are putting your life and others live\\'s in danger. Even if you look down at the time on your phone you are putting yourself into harm\\'s way. \"Texting while driving you are four times more likely to get into an accident rather than just driving without texting\".\\n\\n(Poole 1).\\n\\nUsing your cell phone while driving will increase the risk of you getting into an accident.\\n\\nAt least one out of every twenty drivers will use a phone while driving a vehicle.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of people own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many debate on whether people should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over time, the usage of cell phones has increased drastically. Fatal accidents cause an unwanted feeling in the end. Using your cell phone while operating a vehicle puts other drivers in harm\\'s way. This can be prevented with the simple creation of car gadgets or simply putting your phone on do not disturb or just shut it off.\\n\\nIn my opinion, phone usage in any capacity of moving vehicles should be prohibited. A one minute text or even just being on your phone is not worth your life or anyone else\\'s. According to \"Bran Law Firm\", Almost 200,000 people die from fatal injuries every year. This is equivalent to about one person every three minutes. National averages report about 37,000 crash-related fatalities every year. This breaks down to about 101 deaths per day in the United States. When you are driving a vehicle your main goal is to focus on the roads, and everything going on around you.\\n\\nMany accidents in America are caused by teens and bad drivers. Amongst accidents, an average of nine teens ages 16-19 are killed every day from motor vehicle injuries. 2,739 drivers ages 15-20 are killed and an additional 228,000 are injured in crashes. A total of 4,054 teens between the ages of 13-19 die in car accidents. 81% of teens killed in car accidents are passengers. There are many ways to prevent Teen accidents or accidents in general. Enrolling in driving school, it creates great practice from someone who has amazing driving skills. Don\\'t ever drive drowsy, being sleepy can impair their judgment, vision, hand-eye coordination and reaction times as much as alcohol and drugs. A study by AAA and the National Sleep Foundation found that individuals (regardless of age) who\\'ve slept two hours or less within 24 hours shouldn\\'t be driving at all, and four or five hours of sleep in 24 hours will still leave drivers \"substantially impaired.\"\\n\\nToday there are many gadgets that can help the decrease in accidents. On Instamotor it discusses 5 best gadgets to comply with hand-free driving. One gadget is \"Scosche Magic Mount\". These very inexpensive mounts are available in a variety of attachment methods, from adhesive dash mounts to windshield suction cups, to adjustable arm mounts, and more. The best part of the Magic Mount is that it uses strong magnets to securely hold any phone to its surface. We\\'ve road-tested these mounts ourselves over thousands of miles and find them to be plenty secure even over rough roads. Despite the firm grip, the Magic Mount is typically small and unobtrusive, so it won\\'t look like a small robot is trying to steal your car when it\\'s not in use.\\n\\nAnother useful gadget is called the \"Motorola Roadster Pro In-Car Speakerphone\". If you really don\\'t like the idea of having to pull your phone out of your pocket or purse every time you get into the car to secure it to your dash or windshield, however, and you don\\'t have Bluetooth hands-free calling integrated into your car\\'s audio system, there is another class of gadgets that will serve you well: the two-way Bluetooth in-car speakerphone. These devices typically clip to your sun visor, though some mount to other locations, and act as a traditional office speakerphone, except that they\\'re linked to your cell by Bluetooth, and they\\'re in your car. This means even cars without integrated Bluetooth can have the comfort and convenience of hands-free calling without ever touching your phone at all.\\n\\nTo conclude, always pay attention to the road and do not use your cell phone. If you do so try having something that can easily attach to the glass window especially if its a phone call, try putting your phone on do not disturb next time you enter your car, and always remember that a text that can be sent in seconds it not worth death. How do you think you would be able to drive a car, focus on the roads, and still be able to use your phone         ',\n",
       " \"PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nTexting while driving is one of the worrying trends in the society, both teenagers and adults have developed a habit of using cell phones while driving. Texting while driving causes distraction and increases their chance of getting involved in car accidents. Such concerns have been raised by various government authorities, in trying to prevent such occurrence new laws have been enacted making cell phones use in cars illegal. However, not many people follow these laws, most people text and drive, assuming they can pay attention to other cars. Texting while driving is dangerous for many reasons.\\n\\nCell phone use while driving is the major cause of fatal accident, leaving to deaths. Despite these consequences, people are still fixated on their phones that are dangerous to not only the driver but also to other road users. According to the recent road statistics, more than 22 percent of fatal road accidents are caused by teenagers using their cellphones while driving. Also the distraction of the roads is cause by teenagers who have confidence that they can text or be on the phone while driving. Over more than 5,000 people have died last year due to texting; these accidents are mostly caused by young adults of the age 21 and under.\\n\\nFurthermore, currently there are only 35 states the US have completely banned texting for all its road users, but this isn't enough to stop the problem. Laws that were banning texting while driving will save many peoples' lives. With it being that more than 5,000 people died in the last year caused by distracted drivers. It's very important that the government should take stricter action to try to decrease the deaths caused by theses distracted drivers. It is necessary for the government to enact unifying laws and stricter punishments for those who text while driving.\\n\\nOn the other hand, these news laws need to ban texting while driving for everyone not just for young adults, because it has similar effects on everyone who does it. There should be objection to laws for texting while driving. I feel as if each states needs to have similar laws against texting while driving. For example. Massachusetts laws on texting should be a role model for all of the other states. Massachusetts has the strictest laws on road safety. Punishment for those found texting while driving should be so stiffened to push people to dig deeper into their pockets to pay more. The fine alone is enough; stricter regulations should include license suspension to make people keep off their phones while driving.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, despite the laws forbidding texting while driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text & drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks. Take the pledge to stop texting and driving.                                        \",\n",
       " \"Do you think that drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their phone in the car? I think that drivers should not use their phone in the car. A lot of people get into accidents and some leads to death just because your texting or doing other things on your phone. We all know that cellphones can be really distracting but putting them away can save a lot of lives. Not having your phone out is the same as not having accidents.\\n\\nOne reason why you should not have cell phones is because a lot things can happen which is bad. For example You can be arguing with somebody on the phone and not see that the light turned red and keep going and a truck come and hit you. Arguing while texting can get you into a really bad situation also. While texting you will take your eyes off the road and just like that somebody can cross the street or you can run into something. If the call or text is urgent just pull the car over so you can reply or answer and nobody gets hurt.\\n\\nCell Phones are really distractive in way that you think you can drive and text but really you are in a bad crash. Your brain can tell you to do one thing at a time and when you try and do both, you panic and that can cause a crash. Both driving and texting needs concentrations so when you try to focus on both your mind gets overwhelmed and you crash. Once you get in the car just put the phone away and out of sight. Focusing on the road is the main key on the road than texting.\\n\\nTexting while driving is very dangerous. You need your hands for texting so that requires you to take your hand of the wheel and the car can not be controlled. Not having a controlled car can lead to accidents. Being distracted is the main point by how dangerous texting and driving is. Texting and driving is so dangerous that is way more severe than a drunk driver.\\n\\nFinally, with proven facts, texting and driving is the most dangerous thing to do. There is so many lives getting costed just so you can send a message. Texting and driving is also against the law so unless you wanna pay, put the phone away. Put the phones away because you can hit anybody loved ones and actually kill them and you wouldn't want the same to happen to you. Putting the phones away is saving one life at a time.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nI think that people should be able to use their phones while driving even though it's dangerous. If that person is responsible and can pay attention while driving and looking at their phone once in a while then it should be fine.\\n\\nPhones are a key part of our life, we use it for everything we need but some people can't be away from their phone for a minute and that can be a problem if there driving people. They could get in a car cash a severely injure someone and also put there life at risk or maybe even kill someone. As long as that person is responsible and can pay attention to the road while on their phone it shouldn't be a problem.\\n\\nWhat if there's something really important that you need to handle on your phone and your on the road you can drive and handle your business at the same time instead of waiting until later where you might forget about it later and what if you get a phone call or a text from someone and its important and you can't answer or text them later.\\n\\nThese are some of the reasons I think people should be allowed to you use their phones while driving and some of the reasons and risk of using your phone while driving. I don't think it should be illegal because that's too much because you never know what people got going on these days.\\n\\n1            \",\n",
       " \"In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cellular devices while operating vehicles it increases the rate of car accidents. I also think that there should be a law to completely band cellphone usage while driving. Cell phones are a big distraction while driving because many want to answer a text or a call right then and then they'll lose focus on driving. Drivers should be alert, paying attention to the road to prevent an accident from occurring. If drivers would keep their phones out of their hands while controlling a vehicle it would be fewer car accidents. Many new cars today have phones that are hands free and that is a lot safer than most cell phones. Despite the risks, the majority of teen drivers ignore cell phone driving restriction because they just think they are so cool and they know what they are doing until they get into a car accident. Using cell phone while driving has caused many car accident, many don't understand how distracting a phone can be. Also when texting while operating an vehicle will cause you not to look at the road. So you cant see what's coming or around you. So if you texting or talking on the phone while driving you not paying attention.\\n\\nOperating a moving vehicle while driving takes your eyes off the road and many people when both hands for the phone. Many today are taught how to drive with two hands and if trying to talk while driving they take one hand off the wheel to hold the phone which makes the steering wheel feel more heavier that will cause you to lose the wheel. Also for those who try to hold the phone between their head and shoulder it puts them physically off balance and makes the phone more prone to drop. Which your mind and bodies first reaction would be to pick it up, making you take your eyes off the road. It only takes a quick second for an accident to happen. The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is considerate to other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become lousy. Someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into adjacent lane. The driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slow down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road which leads multiple ways to end up in an auto crash. No texts or calls is worth a bad crash on the highways and roads. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car to merge into a lane, Then they'll pull out in front of you and it could be dangerous.\\n\\nYou don't have a reason to be looking at your phone and driving because their are alternatives you can buy an Bluetooth device that can go in your ear you just have to press an button. Some companies had begun manufacturing hands-free devices that allow you to drive carefully and still be able to answer calls at the same time. You should take that into consideration everyone should drive safe and be careful. In conclusion, You should not use a phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, Because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, And because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answers calls or text when you are going shopping, To work, To a friends house or whatever you may be doing, Consider the consequences.   \",\n",
       " 'Cell Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones have become part of our social culture. These devices are used to send calls or texts to our friends and family members. However, we do not notice the dangers that cell phones pose when someone is driving behind the wheel.\\n\\nTexting while driving has become a phenomenon in our society as we see more people dying because they do not put their phones down. We do not realize that they distract us when we drive causing so many vehicular accidents that could have been prevented in the first place. Drivers should not use their cell phones as they become a distraction on the road.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons that make using our cell phones while driving very dangerous is that it reduces your reaction time. Let\\'s say that you are driving and you receive a text from a friend. You do not become aware that a car in front of you has stopped that you do not have enough time to react to hit the brakes. Limited reaction time leads to a dangerous car crash. We do not realize that looking at our phones more than your driving can lead to a fatal car accident where your life can end in the matter of seconds.\\n\\nTeenagers in our society use their phones to record videos where they end up on social networks such as Snapchat. It has become a trend to record themselves driving behind the wheel without thinking about the consequences that comes with them. Constant phone use when driving has created an unsafe environment where we see young drivers becoming more addicted to their phones rather than focusing on going home safely. Recording a video for Snapchat not only endangers you , the driver, but your surroundings such as pedestrians, your fellow passengers, and other drivers. We must think more about the dangers that we create when we record a video by thinking about what could go wrong. Think about the lives that would be destroyed . This is another reason why accidents happen because many people, especially young teenagers , tend to become careless that they would prefer social media over maintaining control on the steering wheel.\\n\\nHow do we control our cell phone use when we are driving? We need to put our phones away and focus on the road. \" Don\\'t text and drive\" messages seen on billboards are there to remind you and other drivers that it is not a safe using your phone while driving. Other road signs contain a \" drive home safe\" poster for this reason. We cannot risk our lives for an electronic device. We have families that are waiting for us to come home safely.\\n\\nDistracted driving has become a hot topic in many states such as Georgia where we have a \"hands-free law.\" It is illegal to have a cell phone when operating a motorized vehicle. We need to raise more awareness about our cell phones and driving that many posters shown in highways reminds drivers of the dangers they face. Informational commercials with drivers on their cell phones depict their lives where they show that being distracted by these hand-held devices can cause a fatal accident. And that we might not make it home safe . Not only do we have to be tough on drivers, but we have to remind them that we have families . And some of them may never see us again for not putting our phones away.\\n\\nVargas 2            ',\n",
       " \"Phones play a key role in people keeping in touch with one another and accomplishing daily goals and reminders at hand. Driving is a complex task that requires your full and undivided attention, which is a reason why phone use while driving is illegal. In reality, you can make an exception to certain situations when it comes to phone use while driving. These exceptions include emergencies whether it be family or work related, and life of death situations. GPS so people can efficiently and effectively get to and from unfamiliar destinations. Also, some people use their phones as agendas and set daily reminders and goals to accomplish on the daily.\\n\\nTherefore, people should be able to use their phones while driving.\\n\\nCellular devices can be used for many things in a vehicle such as emergency calls. These calls may be work related if you have a on call job. For example, being an on call doctor you would need your phone no matter the circumstances if the hospital needs you. There are other emergencies like if your child was calling because he/she were to be stranded somewhere. Phones may be needed for all types of emergencies.\\n\\nWhile driving vehicles, many use their cell phones for gps. Gps is used for getting to unknown locations. Not only is it used to get to unknown places, many also use it to get from unknown places. Gps can help in so many ways. It helps when you're lost and need to find your way around.\\n\\nCell phones can also be used for daily reminders to get you through the day. When driving these reminders can tell you if you have to be at a place at a certain time. For example, these reminders can remind you if you are losing track of time and have to pick your child up from school. They can also help if you have errands you need to run and forget what you have to do. These reminders and agenda helps you accomplish goals on a daily.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we use our phones in many ways while operating a vehicle. We use these cellular devices if there is an emergency. Cell phones can get you to and from unknown places. Additionally, they can also remind you about things throughout the day. Therefore, cell phones should be used while operating a vehicle.                                 \",\n",

Well, I believe not, people need to be focused on the road ahead and not be all up inside their phone as in don't be texting while driving. This can guide to a whole lot of trouble with people and your car.\\n\\nOperators who have fatal damages in a year are measured in the tens of thousands, and approximately 2.5 million are gravely hurt or forever disabled. The United States has more than 220 million licensed drivers, and they risk their lives every time they enter as a driver or passenger seat. If you're texting while operating a vehicle then you're not paying attention and that could lead to you connecting to someone leading to their death or someone getting seriously injured.\\n\\nWhat the majority of people don't think about is the cost. People or corporations lose money because of thoughtless driving. For instance, accidents caused by cellphone usage leads to big pickup trucks or cause company trucks to drop loads on loads of equipment leaving to great money loss. This can also make a big financial deficient if the truck was hit now we have to pay for damages. This can also lead to bad news if the operator is hurt. If the goods that the driver is haling is damaged or broken that can lead to more money to replace the loss of the haul. The highest price we pay for car crashes is in the loss of human lives, nonetheless, auto industries make steady improvements in vehicle safety over the last several decades but in the year 2014, nearly 32,675 deaths were documented.\\n\\nIn my final judgment, I suppose we can drive safly on our roads without having accidents. Yet I do know that the nature of a human being makes mistakes throughout there lifetime and in those types of situations should be resolved in a courtroom. Furthermore, people who don't follow the law of not texting while driving should have the permits suspend, but we all know that too much of a hassle to deal with. But we need to keep our selves, community, and people protected from harm's way to avoid these types of situations.   \",\n",

Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can't wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it's just sad that people can't wait to text their friends.\\n\\nThe reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 meters per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you. Other figures suggest that someone dumb enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.\\n\\nMy conclusion is that every time you drive while using your cell phone. You not only put yourself in danger but you put the people around you in danger as well I rather see you live another day. We all know it's tempting sometimes to cheek if we got a message or who is calling us but that little second can change your whole life. That's why some people recommend you turn off your phone or put you phone on vibrate so that you won't be to tempted to pick up your phone. Look driving in the highways is dangers because of all the accidents that happen and by you using your cell phone makes it more dangers then it already is. The phone can easily be replaced if dropped or squashed but a live human being cannot.       \",\n",
       " 'Phone & Driving\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is so dangerous. Driving while using a cell phone could cause many accidents and maybe others on the road lives. Using cell phones while driving is illegal but everyone does it and it could cause problems..\\n\\nDriving while using cell phones is known all over the world. There are no less than 75 percent of drivers nominated not only ignoring mobile phones rules while driving but texting as well. People using their phones an any case could cause themselves in trouble, harmed, or probably dead.\\n\\nThe reason why people are using their phones while driving because of the psychological aspect. Not only adults doing it also teenagers are driving and using their cellphones and driving too. The young adults had got to the point that they have to respond back to a text or a call, that they need to learn that a long-awaited response from a text or call does not mean rejection all of the time. The average time people eyes are off the road while texting and driving is a total of 5 whole seconds. In just one second, something could happen. Distracted driving is incredibly dangerous.\\n\\nDriving while using cell phones is a problem that everyone has and need to learn how to adjust that. This requires adults and young adults to be aware to be safe while driving and not use their phone while driving. So adults and young adults, be aware to use your time wisely because that one look at your phone could end up being your last..      ',\n",
       " \"There are a variety of reasons why people should be able to use their cellphones while driving. One reason situation in which drivers would need to use a cellphone is for driving directions. Another reason to use a cellphone while driving would be for an emergency situation, then last would be to report a hazardous road condition.\\n\\nNowadays people are using the new and upcoming driving apps Lyft and Uber. For a driver to know where to pick up and drop off a person who needs a ride. People also love to visit new places and state attractions. For tourists they often uses google maps or cellphone GPS. It's never a good thing to have the phone in your hand or in your cup holder while driving so that's why companies have made phone holders that are placed on the windshield of the car so that you can always keep your eyes on the road while driving to your next destination.\\n\\nAnother reason for use for cellphones while on the road would be for emergencies. Most people have family out of state and many parents worry about their children who attend college out of state and would love to hear from them at any chance they get. Let's take a newlywed couple for example. The husband is on his way to work while his pregnant wife is home resting next thing she knows her water breaks and is on her way to the hospital. When she reaches the hospital she calls him immediately and now he is on route to the hospital.\\n\\nLastly most cellphones are used to contact state or highway patrol to alert them about highway safety related non emergencies. Like if there was a highway/road block or a really bad traffic jam. Most of the time they call highway patrol for vehicle breakdowns/problems, accidents, hazardous material spills, or other highway hazards/problems, as well as impaired or aggressive/reckless drivers and other criminal behavior.\\n\\nSo having a cellphone at your fingertips isn't so bad. Talking on your cellphone while you drive can certainly lead to distraction and accidents but having a cellphone in your car can be very useful in an emergency situation. So the next time you talk on the phone be careful on how you go about it.   \",\n",
       " 'Texting while driving\\n\\nIs it really that important? A text is not more important than your own life. So, what is you lose you job or your boyfriend/girlfriend or an interview, there is always a better job and lover, but no such thing as a life that\\'s better than yours. Just one look can change everything. States in the United States are making laws that prevent you from having your phone in your hands, lap, or chest. While texting while driving is illegal in 47 states, its hasn\\'t stopped some drivers from doing so. Not only are they putting their own life on the line, they risk others too. So, the next time you coming from work, late night, in your feelings, texting your ex how you want them back, blasting Marvin\\'s Room and Jungle by Drake, just remember that you can\\'t get your ex back when you aren\\'t able to walk or worse deceased.\\n\\nTexting while driving is a serious matter. Lives are at risk due to someone wanting to send just one letter to their friend. Since when was texting your friend more important than living to see them again. Some don\\'t even text they just scroll on Instagram to see what\\'s happening. If we still had flip phones and no touch screen people would just answer a call which is better but still risky because you take your focus off the road. Texts aren\\'t gonna kill you if you don\\'t text back, your mom will understand.\\n\\nIn 47 states texting while driving is illegal, but only few have made it illegal to have your phone in your hand or on you body while driving. The state of Georgia, July 4th, when they in-forced that law they racked up more that 35,000+ tickets in one day and that says a lot. If every state did the same, they would most likely accumulate one million 500 thousand tickets in one day. That\\'s a lot of lives on the line, but people act as if they are masters of texting and driving. Little do they know.\\n\\nPhones are a problem in the car. Car crashes have rocketed up dramatically since phones have been introduced. 2007 was the time the iPhone came to be and that was the beginning of something great to turn into a disaster. I read in an article that said; \"American will participate in almost 42 hours a week of seated leisure activities by 2030\". People don\\'t pay attention where they are going or what they are doing when they are on their phone because they looking down and so focused on their phone. I bet if the world was ending most would even know unless they saw it on their phone, but by the time they knew it would be too late. Phones are one worst cause of death due to the lack of attention to everything else on this earth.\\n\\nLook, your phone isn\\'t your life remember that. Not everything revolves around it. A kid want to live to use a phone and drive a car, how about you put the phone down and give them that chance. If you don\\'t have a chance with that girl, don\\'t ruin somebody else\\'s. You phone is always there, and that text might be too, plus you can always get a new phone, but you can\\'t get a new life on earth. Put the phone down and live you life to the fullest, not to the shortest.            ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nWith everything being at the tip of our fingers with our phones, we often find ourselves distracted and overly invested with our phones not even realizing we do it. Using technology is becoming more and more common there are a lot of benefits when it comes to using cellular devices. When there is something positive it can also be used negatively. We shouldn't be able to use our phones while driving because you are far more likely to get into an accident, someone could kill you or you could kill someone else while doing it, and it is illegal to do.\\n\\nIt is scientifically proven that people are unable to multi-task. When you are on your phone and driving you aren't completely focused on the road leading to you crashing into someone or something. When using your phone, you lose your awareness on the road making you valuable to being in a crash. Using your phone while driving and crashing is becoming more common. Putting your phone on do not disturb or letting the person you are texting or calling know that you are about to get on the road can prevent a crash. Waiting to answer or respond to texts or notifications can wait to lose or risking your own life or someone else's is not worth it.\\n\\nAccording to TeenSafe, 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving on any given day and 2.35 million people in the United States are injured or disabled by these car crashes each year. These numbers will only increase year by year if we don't obey laws and regulations pertaining to texting and driving. Despite these number of tragedies, drivers still continue to risk their own lives and others. Even using your phone at a stop sign or at traffic light is dangerous and it should not be done. Just taking one look down at your phone could risk you your life or theirs. We might think that looking down once would be a harmless act, but it puts a strain on attention while driving. The reason why some might text, and drive is because they might have done the harmful act before and gotten away with it and that gives them the confidence in doing it over and over again. People begin to ignore that actual risk of texting and driving and do it over and over again which could ultimately lead to something fatal and dangerous.\\n\\nIn most states they have placed numerous laws about texting and driving and most of them could lead the person to jail time. In the state of Georgia, we have recently passed a new hands-free law, which makes it illegal to be on your phone at all even if you are just holding it. It is even illegal to text while stopped at a traffic light or if you are stuck at traffic. If caught by law enforcement, you could be fined $50 on your first offense and one point on your driver's license. The cost and points taken off increase as you keep doing it which could lead to jail time. And if you get into an accident and it ends in a fatality it could lead to charges of murder with years of jail time. You are still able to use Bluetooth or hands-free calling, but it is still recommended not to use any cellular devices at all because you are not fully focused on the road ahead of you.\\n\\nIn all do not risk your life or others due to a ding or buzz from your phone. Do not be the reason someone loses their own life your takeaway your life because you cannot resist the urge and be patient and wait until you are out of the car to respond or look at your phone. No one wants to be ticketed or sent to jail just because you picked up your cellular device. It is not worth it, and it can wait. We must find some self-control as it becomes harder to contain ourselves from using our phones. With ways such has turning off our phone, putting it on do not disturb or even putting your phone in the backseat.                   \",\n",

So many things can happen you can get in a car accident and lose your life or take someone else's life. There shouldn't be any reason to use your phone in the first place, your eyes should focus on the road only. Driving is no joke you have to worry about everyone around you. It is the person's job who is behind the wheel to make sure everything is safe. Driving itself is a dangerous thing to do and using a phone as well is not a smart thing to do. Cell phones can make you not focus on what's around you when you are in the vehicle.\\n\\nCell phone use while operating a vehicle has became a leading cause of car crashes over two decades. Using cell phones increases the drivers risk of causing a car crash drivers attend to get distracted while picking up the phone.

The only time you can use your phone is if you got into an accident or when you get out the vehicle to go somewhere.\\n\\nMobile phone use while driving is common but it is mostly considered dangerous due to distracted driving and crashes. Voice calling can also cause accidents because the person is focused on talking to the person instead of focusing on driving. People should just stop using their phones 24-7 and just put the phone down. A phone call can always wait until you reach your destination or when you get out of the vehicle. You don't want to get a ticket over being on your cell phone because cops are always watching to see if you are on a phone.\\n\\nSo next time when you get inside a vehicle you should not use a cell phone it is dangers and dumb.

Even driving while on the phone is very dangerous. It can cause accidents. It can lead to death. Sometimes the after effect are worse. Some people may need their device as part of their profession. Using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed.\\n\\nAccording to reports distracted driving is the number one cause of car collisions. The most distracting thing was cellphones. A person trying to send a text or answer his or her phone is the leading cause for car accidents.

Thousands of car crashes occur a year in the United States alone due to distracted driving due to phones and other communication devices. Driving with phones increases the risk of distraction on the road and endanger surrounding drivers.\\n\\nDistractions are inevitable when on the road. However, if it can be prevented, it should. There has been about 400 fatalities alone in Georgia due to distracted drivers. Car accidents are extremely preventable when the source of the accident is phone usage.\\n\\nOf course there are a set of laws in place to find a way to still talk to a person on the phone with hands-free devices but the driver's focus is still limited.

       " 'The Dangers of Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe number of fatal crashes caused by cell phone distracted driving in 2017 was 434 (\"Facts and Statistics: Distracted Driving\"). The amount of fatal accidents from the use of cell phones while driving has only gotten worse through the years. Ever since cell phones have become more advanced and more popular, the danger has increased. It is hard enough to stay focused while driving but phones make that task 10 times as difficult. Even something as simple as changing the song or answering a text for a split second while driving can put yourself and others at risk.\\n\\nTeens play a big part in all of this, being the most likely to use cell phones on the road. Teenagers are not as experienced drivers and think that driving is a task they can take with ease. Although driving might come easy for some, that does not give room to be distracted. I personally witness cell phones being used on the road daily. My mom and my dad both use talk-to-text while driving and my boyfriend holds his phone in one hand while driving with the other. My friend and I almost got into an accident the other day because she was using her phone. Nowadays society is far too attached to technology, especially phones. Not only are teens learning that using phones while driving is acceptable from their parents, they also think that breaking the law is nothing to stress.\\n\\nIn mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be. When someone decides to use their phone while driving they are not only putting themselves at risk, they are endangering every other person on the road. If they look away from the road for even one second and become distracted, they could crash into another person. There could be children in the car that die from the crash, or a pregnant woman. Lives are constantly at stake while in the car, being distracted only makes things worse.\\n\\nCell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (Cell Phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts, teendriversource. org). Teenagers just starting to drive and adults already driving should take preventative measures to be more safe on the road. They could finish a call or text before they begin driving, leave the phone alone while stopped, and put the phone on silent or do not disturb when driving. Most phones now have a driving more that will mute notifications and send a text back to inform the person they are driving. Even if someone is not driving they can still help. If they call someone who happens to be driving, they can say they will call them back later at a better time.\\n\\nSociety as a whole can and should be better and form good habits by not using a cell phone while driving. Distracted driving is a serious topic and the deaths need to be decreased desperately. The safety of people\\'s lives are nothing to take lightly. Even if someone does something as simple as changing the song or answering a text, that automatically puts them and everyone around them in danger.

       " \"Respond at your own risk\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is illegal because it distracts people from the road. Driving and using your phone is very dangerous because you are taking your attention off the road. Which can increase your risk of crashing into someone or something. This is why drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is very dangerous and can increase the chance of an accident jurrasticaly. In 2010 a study was shown that 26% of all crashes were related to using your phone while driving. This shows a quarter of accidents come from people who are distracted by their phones instead of paying attention to the road. Using your phone while driving can not only put the driver's life in danger but everyone around the driver too. This is just one reason why you shouldn't be able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nA second reason to not use while driving is that it reduces your brain activity while driving. So even if you are using your phone and paying attention to the road your brain still doesn't work as well while driving. The brain isn't meant for multitasking and texting or holding your phone and talking to someone is a lot of work for your brain. So it slows down the brain activity you are using towards driving and puts it more towards you using your mobile device. This will reduce your reaction time and your full judgement. These are just some of the reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving.\\n\\nDriving while using your phone is dangerous and can lead to an increase in a crash or misjudgement. Using your mobile phone while driving is illegal for a reason it is dangerous for you and everyone around you. But there will always be people who will use their phone and drive and not get hurt. But using your mobile device increases your chance to get into an accident quite a bit. Use your mobile device before and after you get out of your car not while your in it.          \",\n",
       " \"One of the leading causes of distracted driving is Texting and Driving. 26% of all car crashes happen while texting and driving, also texting and driving is the number one leading cause of death in teens. 31% of people in the united states that text and drive. Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are also injured every day due to texting and driving. More than 42% of teens admit that they text and drive. Texting and driving, makes you take your hand of the steering wheel, your eyes off the road and takes away the point of safe driving. Anything could happen with only one text message like car crashes or hitting someone or both. Teens that drive with someone else in the car could be even more distracting than texting and driving, because usually people who have more people in the car don't focus on the road and most likely won't wear a seatbelt. People usually use their phone in a car to change a music station, searching the web, updating social media and texting.\\n\\nTexting and Driving has been illegal since November 1st, 2015, if caught texting and driving you could serve prison time, license suspension, fines and higher auto insurance. You could serve up to 30 days in prison for using your phone on the road. Texting and Driving is a habit and there are some apps parents could use to monitor the amount off miles, notification blocking and text and call blocking. Some phones are programmed to not allow access while driving but it doesn't mean people still can't get on their phones, usually phones have a notification and asks if you're a passenger and if you hit yes, you could still use your phone. The Newest iPhones are trying to get people to stay off their phones while driving by not allowing to let drivers access their phone. Most newer cars have a button where you could make calls through the car instead of picking up your phone to text someone.\\n\\nAlthough people will never stop texting, I believe there is a way to minimize cell phone use while driving. By putting your phone out of reach for people to get tempted to turn on their phone and it will minimize the habit of using phones. Also by turning the phone on silent, so the person driving doesn't hear it and want to pick it up to check and see what it is. People should learn to break their habits from their phones, most people who see or hear their phone then they pick it up. While on the road, everyone wants for everyone else to drive safe so they could get to point A to point B without getting a crash by unsafe drivers, so I believe if everyone wants to remain safe and to get to their destination, they should just not use it while driving. More ways to not be distracted on the roads are keeping the radio on one station, turning their phone off while driving and driving without passengers.\\n\\nWork Cited:\\n\\n1. https://www. dmv. org/distracted-driving/texting-and-driving. php 2. https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Texting_while_driving 3. http://www. donttextdrive. com/statistics/                                       \",\n",
       " \"Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.\\n\\nLet's start with texts, social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.\\n\\nAs for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.\\n\\nEven hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.\\n\\nWhatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.   \",\n",
       " \"Texting & Driving\\n\\nTexting and driving is against the law. It's very dangerous and has caused many accidents and deaths in the world. Being distracted on your phone while driving is not only unsafe for you, it also puts other people around you in danger. You might think you have everything under control but you never know what might happen. Paying attention to the road is so important and the first priority. You can never give full attention to the road while being on your phone.\\n\\nTexting and driving is dangerous in the world because you can lose control and cause a incident. Due to texting and driving, 1.6 million people a year have been killed or seriously injured. Statistically, we can see that texting and driving is one of the top causes of car accidents in the world.\\n\\nIf you know the data on texting and driving you wouldn't want to take the risk. The person your trying to contact is not worth the consequence of taking someone's life or your own.\\n\\nOne of the many consequences for texting and driving is a fine you will have to pay if you get caught. Texting and driving is against the law in all 50 states. Any driving courses you may taking the dangerous of texting and driving are stressed. Even if you it was unintentional you will be charged with murder if you kill someone while texting and driving. The law should be very important incentive to not text and drive.\\n\\nThe guilt you will feel from taking a life by texting and driving could be unbearable. Knowing that you killed someone from texting and driving would be so devastational. The fact that you could of prevented the accident by just paying attention to the road makes the accident so much harder to deal with. Distracted driving incidents are easy to avoid; just don't use your phone while driving. Thinking about the damage you would cause from a car accident, will make you pay attention to the road.\\n\\nDistracted driving is dangerous for everyone around you. There are many consequence to texting and driving. Fatal accidents is the worst outcome of them all.\\n\\nAnother incentive to not do it is the fine or the incarceration you may receive. Being distracted behind the wheel is one of the biggest issues on the road.                    \",\n",
       " 'According to The National Safety Council, \"the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\".\\n\\nMy opinion is that they should not be able to use cell phones in any situation while operating a vehicle. I think this for multiple reasons such as they can get into an accident, they could harm someone else, and they could easily take a life out of this world.\\n\\nMy first reason why I think they should not be allowed to use cell phones is because it could lead to a car accident with someone else. For example, on the News 24 website the driving states this, \"\"I was trying to get my phone on the bed behind me. It was ringing. I did this while I was driving. I\\'m sorry about this I should have stopped the truck.\" This shows that many people don\\'t think about their surroundings within the reality and rather have their phones.\\n\\nMy second reason why is because they could harm someone else. It is proven that nearly 390,00 injuries happen during accidents that involve the use of cell phones. For example, an article on livestrong. com states , \"traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for American teens, and when it comes to distracted driving, young people are among the most likely to text and talk behind the wheel.\" This proves that many accidents harm other people when the collision happens or within the next few days after the collision.\\n\\nWhile some may say they need it for if their family is having an emergency and they had to make a quick phone call, you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.\\n\\nToday, many states within the United States are making it a law to drive with a phone in your hand and can take you to court and write you a ticket for driving with a phone in your hand. Do you want to be in an accident with someone who was on their phone?             ',\n",
       " 'No Phones Allowed While Driving\\n\\nToday, many people both own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. So much so, that many have developed the tendency to do so while operating a vehicle. This current trend of behavior among drivers has caused a series of debates as to whether or not one should be allowed to use their phone while driving. Due to the many risks that come with a distracted driver. Thus, why drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nWhile operating a vehicle, it is important for drivers to stay focused on the road. However, cell phones are one of the most common causes of distracted driving related accidents. (The Most Common Causes of Distracted Driving). According to 4 Reasons Why You Shouldn\\'t Text and Drive by B City of Bryan, \"Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you\\'re texting and driving.\" In addition, it generally only takes a driver about five seconds to travel the length of a football field when traveling around 55mph. This means that when drivers become distracted by their cell phones, they create a large window of opportunity for disaster to strike.\\n\\nIn most cases, people think that they can keep their eyes on the road while operating their cell phone at the same time. In contrast, drivers who allow themselves to get distracted by their cell phones increase their chances of getting into an accident, as well as putting themselves and many others life\\'s at risk. For example, a distracted driver is, \"...23 times more likely to be in an\\n\\nHearing 2 accident,\" than a non-distracted driver. (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration). To continue, \"texting while driving is to blame for... 1,600,000 accidents per year, 330,000 injuries per year, and 11 teen deaths every day.\" (National Safety Council, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis Study, Institute for Highway Safety Fatality Facts). Therefore, it is proven that a distracted automobilist is a hazard for not only themselves, but also other motorists and pedestrians.\\n\\nFurthermore, due to all the costly risks that come with texting and driving, such action has been made illegal in many states. Andrei Zakhareuski, from Driving Tests, proclaims that, \"Those who are caught will be issued a citation by a policeman who will most likely be quite perturbed at the driver\\'s ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident sites...,\" and believes that, \" ... A text message that reads \"ok\" isn\\'t worth a couple hundred dollar fine.\" Not to mention, those involved in a distracted driving related accident risk jail time, and most certainly, an increase in insurance rates. According to, 10 Pragmatic Reasons That Will Make You Stop Texting and Driving Today, \"If texting and driving is included in the police report for an accident or wreck for which you are held responsible, you\\'ll notice an even more significant rate increase. In some cases, your policy might be dropped completely.\" Such a spike in cost or dropping of a policy would severely impact a driver. Hence, texting while driving is not worth the risk.\\n\\nWith the current trend of texting and driving, and all its risks included, drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle. For, texting while driving takes a driver\\'s attention off the road and endangers the lives of any passengers, other motorists, and\\n\\nHearing 3 pedestrians. Moreover, texting while driving increases a driver\\'s chances of getting into an accident. As follows, once involved in a texting and driving related accident, either a driver\\'s cost of a premium will skyrocket, or he or she will get dropped from their policy. To conclude, it is not safe nor wise for an automobilist to operate a cell phone while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nZakhareuski, Andrei, \"10 Pragmatic Reasons To Stop Texting and Driving Today\", Driving Tests, 1 May 2019, https://driving-tests. org/beginner-drivers/10-reasons-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/\\n\\nLohmann, Raychelle C., \"Why shouldn\\'t I text while driving?: Safety & Preparedness\", Sharecare, https://www. sharecare. com/health/safety-preparedness/text-while-driving\\n\\nB City of Bryan, \"4 Reasons Why You Shouldn\\'t Text and Drive\", City of Bryan, Texas, 8 Januaray 2020, https://www. bryantx. gov/4-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/\\n\\nLuhrsen, Julie, \"Investigating the most common causes of distracted driving\", Luhrsen Goldberg, LLC., 15 February 2020, https://www. lginjuryfirm. com/common-causes-distracted-driving/                            ',\n",

       " 'Cells phones are very common place for everyone to own and use on a daily basis. Cell phones are used by most people in all aspects of their lives which means even when they are operating a motor vehicle. Being distracted by cell phone use while driving can cause injuries and death. Using a cell phone while you are driving takes attention that the driver should be paying to what is going on around them. This split second of attention spent on the cell phone could cause the driver or those around them their lives. People should not use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nDriving a motor vehicle requires a driver to be aware at all times of what is going on around them. They need to be able to react at a moments notice. If a driver is using a cell phone they will not be placing their full attention on driving and accidents can happen. When a driver is distracted, not only do they put their life in danger, but they also endanger the lives of those on the roads with them.\\n\\nSure a cell phone can be a good tool to use for navigational purposes, or a cell phone is great to have in the event of an emergency. The cell phone can help the driver get help quicker than they could in the past because they have instant access to a communication device. The cell phone gives its owner instant access to the Police, EMS, and Fire with the push of a couple of buttons. A cell phone can be a great tool, but it can also be a deadly one. Cell phone use should only be conducted hands free while a person is operating a vehicle in order to cut down on the distraction it can cause.                                            ',\n",

People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in todays generation. Some people think that they are a experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council reports that \"cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". These statistics are frightening and eye opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to a AAA poll \"94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyways.\" Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.\\n\\nThe risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.\\n\\n(Texting and Driving Accident Statistics, 2018)\\n\\nBrown 1         ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nCar accidents seem to have been increasing due to the uproar of phones. More people have become distracted whether it's texting or driving, you're on a phone call, or just being on social media while driving, and with all these action being done while driving it's causing a lot of deaths in car accidents. According to the National Safety Council 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers being on the phone, with 314,000 of those incidents involved text messages. Using the phone while driving is reckless and needs to come to an absolute stop.\\n\\nAs more and more people gain more access to a phone texting and driving (or using the phone regardless) has almost become normal. Young drivers are the most at risk because using the the phone while driving distracts the brains and eyes from driving. Since technology will further blossom in the near future, the best way for teens to learn and prevent car crashes is advice from parents. Parents should talk to their young teen drivers about the safety of driving so they can prevent a car accident of worst. Parents should also avoid calling and texting their child while driving to insure the safety of their teen.\\n\\nIt's not just teen drivers at risk when they're using their phone while driving, adults are at a high risk too. In fact adults are put at a higher risk because studies have shown adults are more likely to use their phone and drive due to them thinking that since they have more experience behind the wheel. Adults are equally responsible behind the wheel just as much as a teen is when it comes to using a phone. In 2012 over 3000 people died in car accidents with someone in either car being a distracted driver. If anything adult drivers should be held more to a higher standard simply because they are older and have to lead by example for up and coming drivers who learn how to drive by watching whatever adult drives them around. Let only it may be more dangerous to an adult driver because 9 times out of 10 they are driving with a passenger or even worse a someone's child or a child of their own. When driving adults should be more careful while being on the phone and driving because they never know who's watching them.\\n\\nDistracted drivers in this current day in age need to be a lot more careful. Because every day more and more people are now getting on the road and becoming a distracted driver and not being aware of what's going on, on the road around them. All distracted driving needs to come to a halt so everyone can one day and not having to worry about if their teen drivers is going to make it home okay or if they would make it home today.       \",\n",

Cell phones should never be used while in control of a vehicle.\\n\\nLaws preventing cell phone use while driving is the best thing to happen to this country.\\n\\nAccording to the NSC cell phone use while driving is the top distraction and almost everyone uses their cellphones while driving, almost all the time. By using vehicle data sensors from over three million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of travel time, driving company Zendrive discovered that drivers use their phones on 88% of their time behind the wheel. Average motorists spend about 3.5 minutes using a phone per hour trip, a fact that is even worse when you see that just a two-second text boosts the risk of a wreck by 20%.\\n\\nDriving a car and talking on the phone both require a lot of thought to perform. By texting and driving at the same time of each other, it is impossible for your brain to do both with 100% accuracy. Just like it's almost impossible to read and talk on the phone. Doing this while driving, often causes crashes because of the delayed stopping times and reactions to traffic signs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Cell phone use while driving is a bad idea. It hurts many who are involved and is not safe what so ever. If everyone put the phones down and refrain from texting the whole world would be safer.

The chances of crashing while texting is just as high. Many people who text and drive are teenagers new to driving, and most likely not used to paying attention only on the road. Young people are early to most new technology, and on that technology is social media, a somewhat more elaborate set of texts.

These distractions are causing families to lose loved ones and to constantly mourning when these incidents can be avoided.\\n\\nTexting is one of the main issues when using cell-phones while driving. \"According to The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.\" (edgarsnyder. com) Not only does cell phone use while driving cause crashes it also cause deaths.

Teens are very distracted in general when it comes to school, relationships, social media,etc. This means that their minds are already running a mile per minute. This causes them to be in high risk of getting into accidents because their full attention is not on the road. On top of this when teens are texting and driving this completely takes their entire attention away from the road and not only puts their lives at risk but also leaves other drivers, pedestrians, and passengers in their cars at risk.\\n\\nDriving distractions are not only caused by cell-phones there are other factors to consider.\\n\\nThese factors include cognitive, visual, and manual; Cognitive consists of taking your mind off driving. Visual includes taking your eyes physically off the road. Lastly, manual means to take your hands off the wheel.

Even though this law has been put into effect drivers are still using cell-phones. The consequence for not adhering to this law is a 100 dollar fine, a ticket, and a bad note on your license. Due to drivers ignoring this law people are continuing to become injured and worse lose their lives. To prevent these horrific things from occuring providers have made a system while driving on the phones that enables a person from receiving messages while driving. With these provisions we should see a substantial difference in the death and injury toll in our communities.   ',\n",

According to teensafe. com, 58% of teen crashes has been linked to distracted driving. It only takes three seconds after a driver takes their eyes off the road for a crash to occur.

Although calling someone while driving does distract the driver, it is a little safer than texting and driving. As long as the call is bluetooth and handsfree then there is no problem with that being allowed while driving. There should be an exception to that which is that any driver under the age of 18 should not have their phones out at all, not even wireless calling.\\n\\nTexting and driving has no beneficial outcome, so there is no reason to do it.

The insurance will be raised very high, there will be medical bills for the injured party that has to be paid, there will be fines to be paid, possible jail time, and suspension of your driver's license. Nothing good comes from texting and driving. The vehicles after a wreck will be damaged and it will just be unnecessary stress and problems added to a driver's life that could have been prevented.\\n\\nMany states, including California, has already banned the use of cellphones while driving. There is a hands-free law that prohibits having a cellphone in your hands while driving. Distracted driving is never a good idea, no matter how important someone believes the message is.

A story of a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have indented to end that person life, but she made one of the worst decision someone could ever make phones while driving which I think is a smart thing to do.

Most people have their own cellular devices. All around, it\\'s extremely useful, but can also be very distracting leading to mishaps occurring. Lots of people like you and I have a horrible habit of using our phones, while operating dangerous machinery like automotives. Which increases the risk of accidents occurring. Laws should restrict the usage of cell phones use while driving on the road to prevent accidents from transpiring.\\n\\nDistractions lead to mishaps happening more often increasing the risk of injury to oneself and others around them. Many people use their cell phones while driving. In fact, \"1 out of 3 people text while driving\" and \"texting while driving increases the risk of crashing by 23 times\" (NHTSA, 2019). Sometimes drivers get distracted but, \"the maximum amount of time a driver can safely divert their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds - on average - to send a text message\" and \"82% of American teens have a cell phone. 52% of these teens note that they talk on the phone while driving and 32% text on the road\" (TeenSafe, 2019). Everyday there is an accident and everyday \"11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving\" (TeenSafe, 2019). This loss of life can be avoided if there are regulations limiting the usage of cell phones.\\n\\nLaws should be kept in place to help prevent the usage of cell phones while driving. With these laws unnecessary loss of life can be avoided, and accidents prevented. Every time someone is distracted on the road it increases the risk of a fatal accident.

When people are engaged in a conversation, be it on a call, texting or even with someone else in the car while there attention is divided. People only have so much attention to spare In fact, with there are very few magic numbers in life, there is a magic number associated with how many things people can attend to at once and it's not a lot. People needs to be consider about their responsibility and other people that are driving and walking. Using mobile devices while driving is dangerous also a hazards.

       " 'Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else\\'s lane and didn\\'t notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else\\'s life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.\\n\\nFirst, ask yourself if the text or notification you received is more important than your life or than the people on the road with you. If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone\\'s life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults\\' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people\\'s friends dead because they couldn\\'t wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn\\'t mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead.\\n\\nSecondly, \"In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists.\" All these deaths could have been avoided if the person could have just waited until they stopped or until they got to their destination. Your parents tell you to text or call before you start driving for a reason so they won\\'t lose their child or see their child hurt. \"Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent.\" So this shows that texting can make you forget important things you are supposed to do before or while driving.\\n\\nLastly, \"Typing text messages reduces a driver\\'s ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles.\" This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else\\'s life could be put in danger or worse, taken away. No notification is worth someone\\'s life. You can easily take someone\\'s life young or old by a simple text. Before you start driving, call and text everyone that needs to be called or texted and if they call or text wait until you stop or get to your destination.                      ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nDrivers should they or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not attend to a mobile device while operating a vehicle. This action is the main source of car accidents due to decreasing the drivers awareness on the road causing injury and/or death .\\n\\nSome states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving to take precaution. Driving distracted is one of the main causes of car accidents over the last two decades. Each year 6 million cases of car accidents take place, which roughly per day is 16,438. About 3 million people are injured or disabled and 6,000 deaths happen annually. According to statistics in 2010 the loss of human lives due to car accidents cost almost 1 trillion dollars, the highest price we pay for the loss of others in the collision of vehicles.\\n\\nMost states have passed or are passing a law, illegal to use your phone while operating a vehicle. Most states banned use of cell phones while driving are different from others or either similar. For example the state of Georgia banned all drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers to the utilization of phones. As in Arizona school bus drivers and learner's permit and existing license holders during the first six months after licensing aren't allowed to operate a mobile device while the driver's vehicle is in motion. Although these states' rules are slightly contrasted from each other, the use of texting, hand held calls, and possession of devices in the palm is prevented.\\n\\nCell phones are a very dangerous distraction to you and those around you, but can have its benefits such as navigation and the use for help or assistance. Many cell phones have GPS assistance which provide direction to arrive at your designated destination. Cell phones also allow users to contact aid whether its an ambulance, the police, or help with your car while on the road. Although these actions are very safe they should not be acquired while a vehicle is in motion to prevent any dangerous interactions.\\n\\nIn conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving. Put down your mobile device, the call or text received is worth the wait than worth being in a major or minor accident. Without the distraction your attention is focused on the road and your surroundings. This action taken is safer for you and your environment.\\n\\nWork Cited http://www. rmiia. org/auto/traffic_safety/Cost_of_crashes. asp https://www. ncsl. org/research/transportation/cellular-phone-use-and-texting-while-drivin aws. aspx\\n\\nGoogle               \",\n",
       " 'No Cell Phones Driving\\n\\nThere should be no cell phones while people are behind the wheel. This can increase traffic, cause crashes, and can even get you pulled over. There is no text that is worth the risks that you take by using it while driving. Most may use it for gps but that is something that can be used before you start your car, and it can be put on speaker so you can hear the directions. It can only take one time that you think its ok to pull it out; only for it to cause you time, money, and quite possibly your life.\\n\\nUsing your cell phone while operating a vehicle is also a hindrance on other drivers as well. The phone is a distraction that can slow down the smoothly moving traffic and back things up. Examples are not paying attention to the change of lights while sitting at a red light. That keeps others from moving along with their driving and will cause traffic jams in big cities where cell phone usage is most used. Which in big cities can be a big factor to car crashes\\n\\nIn most states having your cell phone out while driving is illegal for newer drivers and can be punishable with the suspension of your license. For others the punishment can be a fine that goes up to $150 in Georgia which is one of the highest in the country. Having to deal with a fine given and being pulled over can stop you from getting to your destination to a party , meeting, or even just home. Now you run the chance of being late because you needed to check your phone while driving. Even if you are just checking for a split second you open yourself to the risks of your divided attention.\\n\\nOn the other hand people justify the usage of phones while driving a vehicle as an emergency that they can\\'t miss. Sometimes you run into those calls or texts that you just cant miss. Understanding that yes, life does get in the way and some things need urgent reactions. You can just as quickly stop on the side of the road to not only be safer while checking the emergency, but also giving your full attention to the matter rather than half and half. You will be able to safely deal with the emergency that arises calmly as well since you are stopped, such as setting the gps to a new destination if needed, or even finding a new place to eat.\\n\\nWhile people think they can use their phones and drive, it\\'s not the smartest idea. Crashes, traffic backups, and fines are all outcomes from using them. It puts not only you in danger but others as well The text or call you miss is not worth what you could pay. The payment could range from money you may not have, or even your or somebody else\\'s life.

Some of the reasons are that people use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or even going on the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Truth be told people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. We all have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and safety of others because of our phones.\\n\\nWhat people should know is that other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Retarded driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of again the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. For example a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. A person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. A more reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In more studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.\\n\\nIn the United States car crashes due to distracted driving are increasing.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nToday in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16.\\n\\nIn my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one\\'s driving skills.\\n\\nAlso if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they\\'re putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states \"Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times.\" Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash.\\n\\nHowever, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car.

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush.

Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.

Driving with distractions from a noisey cellphone is kind of like driving under the influence of drugs. It\\'s just too much going on at one time which could also cause an accident.\\n\\nWhen the light turns greens and you\\'re on your phone, what do you think happens? Traffic accidents. Or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you\\'re busy on your cell phone and \"boom\" you hit them? There was a possibility you could have ended their life. That phone call or text message could\\'ve been responded to when you got to your destination. Am I right? Now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there\\'s traffic somewhere. My mother won\\'t even let me drive because she\\'s hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. Would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? No I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nAlso, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. There are many ways of causing an accident but \"Driver error is most often the result of \"distracted driving.\" By far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones\" according to Dr. Daniel Landers. But why is a phone more important than your safety? It shouldn\\'t be. There are now many states in the United States with the \"hands free\" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.\\n\\nIn conclusion, laws have been enacted to protect all citizens from distracted drivers.\\n\\nSpecifically drivers who use their cellphones responsibly with hands free devices ensures that all citizens get to their destination safer than when these laws weren\\'t in effect. As a result, drivers can expect decreased insurance costs in the future.   ',\n",
       " 'Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. There is a new law called \"hands free\" where people that own a cell phone cannot operate it while driving. This has effected people that own motor vehicles in many ways. People need their phones to direct their self\\'s places or answer emergency texts or calls.\\n\\nThe new \"hands free\" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you\\'re driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn\\'t connected to Bluetooth while you\\'re driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you\\'re connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don\\'t have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law. The \"hands free\" law shouldn\\'t be a law.\\n\\nAlthough the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. \"Incredibly, they also spent less time watching the road, even when they were texting by voice.\" Stated in the Text Free is No Safer to use while driving. The Texas A&M Transportation institute studied people driving a closed course under three conditions: while texting by hand, while texting by voice, and by not texting at all. It seems as if texting by voice should be safer than looking at your phone, but studies show that texting by voice and by looking at your phone, the reaction time is still the same.\\n\\nThe hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way. Yes, talking on the phone while your driving is a dangerous distraction. \"Many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation\" Stated in the \"Total bans may be impractical\" debate. Studies show, an in depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short. The time and the length of the phone call is what is dangerous.\\n\\nEven though the hands free law can help with the risk of car accidents and keep people off their phones while driving, studies have shown that wether your texting by voice or looking at your phone the risk of crashing is the same. The hands free law should not be in play.                  ',\n",

Using a mobile phone while driving can cause a fatal accident. There are several reasons why you need to ban phones during driving, such as sending a text message, making a phone call, using a mobile electronic device. There are many dangers when using mobile phones while driving.\\n\\nYou should not speak with your mobile phone while driving. You will be distracted by telephone conversation. This is similar to driving while you are drunk. If you talk on the phone while driving, the reaction may be delayed if accidental driving hazards occur. Or you will never feel danger until too late. More and more research shows the danger of distracting, and hands free phones do not seem to bring much improvement, if any. There are more incidents of speaking on the phone than text messages, but this may be due to the fact that the the phone is widely used (compared to text messages).\\n\\nThe problem with social issues today is the fact of text messaging an driving. When it comes to text messaging, you want to immediately notify you when you know your phone. It is very important to silence your phone while in safe driving. It affects only one person, and it also affects people around you. Because of the adverse impacts caused by many accidents, text messages and driving are illegal.         ',\n",
       " \"Driving Distracted\\n\\nMany drivers usually text and drive even if it's just to change a song. During this time one can easily become distracted from the road. This is how accidents occur and there are some who use their phone constantly and don't see a problem. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.\\n\\nWhen people are driving and receive a notification or a call on their phone the first thing they might do is check it. This can cause many problems as in that second that you are looking at your phone you can become easily distracted. This is how most accidents occur. Also when the driver begins to text and drive their focus is on what there texting instead of the road. In that time that you are looking at your phone you can hit a pothole or simply lose control of the vehicle endangering you and the other people on the road. There are also people who when they begin to text and drive they take their hands off the steering wheel. This is extremely dangerous because if the car begins to swerve you will have a delayed reaction and less time to react.\\n\\nLaws have been implemented as to stop the use of phones while driving. In Georgia a law was implemented called the hands free which means while driving you may not use anything that may distract you. These laws have good intentions but many simply choose to ignore them. Even with these laws accidents still occur because of phones many just simply don't care. When people ignore these laws they need to be enforced better as many still text and drive. Even with laws in place many will text and drive and not care for others or themselves.\\n\\nThere are some uses for phones while driving but one should never text and drive. The main use for using a phone while driving is to use the gps. Using a gps does not require for you to be texting and driving if you set the destination beforehand. You can also simply put your phone in a do not the disturb so that you will not become distracted or turn your phone off. There are also apps to help you limit the use of texting and driving as you can make your phone not receive messages while you are driving.\\n\\nEven with laws or apps many will still text and drive. This still causes many problems as you are not only endangering you but the people around you. Phones should only be used for directions while driving or not at all. Stricter laws should be imposed so people won't text and drive. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.                     \",\n",
       " 'The Dangers of Texting and Driving\\n\\nTechnology has come a long way, making it near to irresistible, but that can come at a serious cost. Smartphones connect everyone to everything; other people, the news, the weather, GPS, and social media. Smartphone also connect to vehicles with being able to change music, take calls, and adjust GPS. These features sound great and helpful, but they can cost lives. A person who takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone are easily distracted from their surroundings. During their distractions they have high risks of injuring themselves and others. Texting and driving is dangerous to everyone.\\n\\nApproximately one out of four car crashes in the United States is caused by texting and driving. In sixteen states, along with United States territories: Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, even holding your phone while driving in general is illegal. In nineteen states, holding while driving in the presence of children, in the case of bus drivers, is illegal as well. Just how dangerous is cell phone use while driving if it is banned in almost twenty states? According to the CDC, \"Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.\" (CDC.gov). Texting while driving can not only take your life, but an innocent bystanders\\'. Even though everyone knows these dangers, yet people still text and drive.\\n\\nTo understand why people still text and drive, there is context on just how much people use their phones every day. According to study by Dscout, the average person will touch their phones 2,617 times a day; they will spend around four hours in total every day going through their phone. With every alert and message the phone gives off, people are more likely to check it. Social media updates and a quick text message may seem like a safe way to use your cellular device while on the highway, but in reality those few seconds their eyes are down to their screens, can cause disaster. Phone use has been shown to be highly addictive and American cellular companies need to make phone easier to ignore while on the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving is harmful to everyone. The people who are injured or are killed, their friends, and their families alike. Ways to connect your phone to the car completely hands free needs to be taught to everyone. The unnecessary phone activity needs to diminish. Phones are highly addictive but they will never be as important as someone\\'s life.                     ',\n",
       " 'IF DRIVERS SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE CELL PHONE WHY DRIVING\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, int ernet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of theset hings at the same t ime. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one t ime that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can\\' t put down our cell phones.\\n\\nUsing a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the drive r themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on t he road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phoneswhether they want to or not because of the hazards they creat e. Err atic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.\\n\\nAs scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consult ancy\\n\\nBuzzM aven Labs, says \" [He] came wit hin inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of t ra ffic at 45 mph.\" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro (tailgating) the minivan full of kids.\" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestr ians.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are number of traditional ways that distracts driver\\'s attention.\\n\\nThey include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver\\'s performance.\\n\\nDrivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving. It can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.   ',\n",
       " 'CR Driving & Texting!\\n\\nI strongly agree that phones should be banned while driving because of all the accidents they are causing. These are causing insurance to rise and causing scare to people\\'s health. Studies have proven that drivers who use phones while driving are more responsible for the cause of an accident. Driving is dangerous technique and to safely execute driving you should be 100% focused, but if you are drunk or on your phone, you are potentially in danger to yourself and others on the road. As a society, we have become very less mindful of everything going on around us and do not take much precaution of things happening right in front of us.\\n\\nMany people think distractions while driving is only texting and driving but in fact, while driving, sometimes it is easy to lose focus on the road because you are on the phone or because so much could be happening around you, but this means you forget you are on the road with others, instead of by yourself. Research has it, \" The available studies so far suggest that talking on the phone while driving, even hands-free, is as bad or worse than driving drunk. ... A test of 41 adults found that driving while intoxicated was actually less dangerous than driving while talking on a hand-held phone or a hands-free phone.\"                                                       ',\n",
       " 'Should Drivers be allowed to use their phones?\\n\\nMany people like to use their phone while driving for many reasons. Whether it\\'s for changing the music or to yell at the GPS when you get lost. Sometimes there are emergency phone calls that make you feel like they can\\'t wait. Especially with the growth of technology drivers are most likely to grab their cellphones. Many of these reasons are the main cause of car accidents that happen in today\\'s world. With distractions from the road drivers are most likely to swerve into the other lane or crash into another. Therefore Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle for the safety of others and for themselves.\\n\\nDue to a report of accidents that happened in 2018 about \"40,000 people lost their lives to car crashes\" and 4,637 of those people died in the crash due to cell phone usage. Texting and driving can cause about 5 times as many accidents as drunk driving. Technology has grown and so has the usage of cellphones. Nowadays people use their phone to locate the nearest coffee shop or to watch their shows, the thing is they watch it at the most inappropriate time. Instead of focusing on the road the driver puts all their attention towards the phone causing them to swerve into the other lane or hit another car that\\'s slowing down on the highway. In the state of Georgia there was a bill that was passed known as the House Bill 673. This bill is also known as the `Hands Free Law \\' \\'\\'. This law basically says that under no condition should the cellphone be in the driver\\'s hand at any time. The consequence of this bill is a \"Fine of $50-$150 depending on the offence\" (Google). With this bill passed many more civilians will be able to not use their phone and be less likely to get into accidents because if the driver gets caught with it they will have to pay a fine and get a point on their license.\\n\\nTexting and driving is not only risky but can put the driver and other drivers on the road lives on the line. Just because a driver can get away with texting and driving once doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t catch up to them one day. Based on a real event a teen killed a father and his 10 year old daughter after she \"ran a red light because she was allegedly texting\" (teensafe. com). The teen was sentenced to 4 year probation and had to do community service. Not only could the driver take one\\'s life and be scarred but could also do damage to their family members. That is why there are clubs and teen meets that talk about the danger of texting and driving and most of the teachers have experience the horror themselves or had lost a loved one due to an event like the mother of a teen in washington who \"Died after she was allegedly distracted by an incoming text while driving\" (teensafe. com) the mother \"now helps teens understand the dangers and uses a video that recreates her daughters crash to illustrate the horror\"\\n\\nTherefore texting in driving in any state should not be allowed, in fact it should pass the \"hands Free Law\" in every law that should prohibit the driver from touching their phone or having any part of their body supporting the phone. Not only will this help the safety of the driver but will benefit the other drivers on the road. More teen clubs should be made in order to get the message out on the dangers of texting and driving in order to prevent accidents from distracted drivers. As technology grows, so will distractions.              ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn today's society, people have and use cell phones. Cell phones have become an addiction. People can't seem to put them down. Some people feel that people should not use their phones while driving their cars. I feel this way too. Using cell phones while driving have negative consequences in two ways. One, cell phones distract the driver. Two, cell phones are unsafe.\\n\\nTo begin with, phones can easily distract the person who's driving the car. The reason is that when that person is driving his car and when a notification ringer goes off, the driver would rush to his phone to see what came up. When this happens, he would then lose focus on the road and might kill someone. Whenever someone is driving his car he needs to focus on the road at all times. Distract driving is one of the main reasons why there's more car accidents in this country, especially Georgia. When the government starts enforcing no phones while driving, this will help end distractive driving and less car accidents would happen in cities and on the highway. Cell phones distracting the drivers is one of the main points why people should not use their phones while driving a car.\\n\\nNext, drivers who use their phones while driving can be unsafe for the driver and other people who are around them. The reason is that when drivers are driving, they need to check their surroundings to make sure they do not hit someone or something. In the case of using a phone while driving can cause many deaths from getting run over/ hit from the car or from a car crash. This is really important that people need to be aware of what they're doing because if they make one mistake, it can cause a lot of lives. Safety is really important when it comes to using a phone because people can save lives if they put the phone down and focus on the road so that everyone can create a safer environment for people who want to drive their car. Most deaths are caused by car accidents due to using the phone while driving because people do not think about being safe not only for themselves but also the passengers who are in the car with them. Safety is one thing people need to take a stand on, because drivers need to realize that if they do not put the phone down, then it could create more deaths and less safety in the area.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers who use their phone while in the process of driving can end in an unsafe situation not only for themselves, but everyone that is around them. Distracting driving and safety are the two reasons why people should not use their phones while in the process of driving. Phones can easily take away the focus on the road because it leads to bad outcomes in the end.                           \",\n",
       " 'Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nDrivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting. While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the \"National Safety Council\" \"Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage.\" Not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash. Well According to \"Teen Safety\" \"Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash.\"\\n\\nDistracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident.\\n\\nWhen drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else\\'s life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them.\\n\\nSo in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone\\'s life whether it\\'s the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.

       " \"Phones and Cars\\n\\nMany habitants of planet earth have and use their cellular device as second nature. Cellphones, while useful in the sense of communication, entertainment, and business transactions, can be dangerous tools of distraction behind the wheel. An example of this would be the statistics based on vehicular manslaughter and other effects of the car accidents that are recorded each year. Tens of thousands of Americans are victims of car accidents every year with the distraction of cellphones being the lead cause for fender benders every year. Governments officials and representatives are faced with the same issue and must constantly find a solution to the issue of cellphone use behind the wheel. The main question being whether cell phone use should be allowed at all while operation heavy machinery.\\n\\nThat being said, it would be for the better of humanity if cellphones be allowed only when at a complete stop with the vehicle in park. The reason why the allowance would be more beneficial than the stripping of the whole ability is because of the instinctual nature of humans to do what seems good even if it is forbidden. This can be seen in the Book of Genesis, where Eve chooses the forbidden fruit over every other fruit in the garden, due to the thought that she would never be able to taste that specific fruit if she were to obey God's orders. This shows the weakness in man, that, even if he or she should be shunned, smitten, banished, or punished in any way by the highest power, man shall carry out the forbidden just to have a form of secret liberty.\\n\\nThis liberty would remain in the citizens' mindsets if they had the ability of freedom that would be disguised by regulations. The perception of a freedom is a more effective way to regulate the general population that the prohibition of the acts that are the root of a problem, such as the case of the dangers of texting and driving. The first regulation would include the full stop of a vehicle, ensuring that the driver is not endangering the lives of everybody else when they need their phone. The second part of the new rule would call for the mandatory parking of the car, so that the car has no potential to endanger the other lives on the road. These rules would send the message that the nation needs to stay focused on the task of driving and should refrain from getting distracted by phone use.\\n\\nThe task of driving is a boring task, thus the temptation of using a device to make the job of travel less monotonous becomes more alluring to the driver. Therefore, the use of cell phones should still be partially allowed for those who ride the road every day. To ask for the privilege be taken all together would cause uproar and rebellion, but to give that chance to change a song on the phone, or to reroute the GPS software on the phones leaves a margin of freedom for the civilians who are forced to follow the policy. Without those exact laws, every nation will continue to face accidents and become yet another percentage on the yearly submission of the quota for accidents and deaths caused using cell phones.\\n\\nOverall, to avoid becoming a statistic in the list of deaths, it would behoove the general populations to insert these regulations into their driving lives. This would promote a safer environment for travel and would reduce the number of driving hazards and obstacles by a grand percentage. All it takes to keep oneself safe and others safe is the awareness and comprehension of the activity on the road, rather than the activity on a phone.                                        \",\n",

If its an emergency you should pull over and put your car in park and do what you need to do instead of endangering yourself or other drivers on the road with you.\\n\\nMany people say that hands free set is a safety because you have 2 hands on the wheel instead of one on your phone and the other on the wheel. But however i think its still not safe because you would be more into texting or calling someone instead of driving. People have been immune to their phones that they gotta be on their phone every second even while driving. Its not just young drivers its older experienced drivers too.\\n\\nMany more people say its not safe to drive while with your phone because your endangering your life and other drivers. The leading causes of death in a car accidents are drunk drivers or distracted drivers. Now a days you cant just drive your car you gotta look around your surrounding for an example cars swerving in your lane while on their phone. What would you do?

What ever is on your phone could wait because its not going away instead of risking your life while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, don\\'t use your phone or operate your phone while driving because it can lead to many more problems than texting back\"ok\". You don\\'t want to end up in the hospital thinking why did i do that i should\\'ve waited. Your not going to think about that while driving. Obvious the person your texting don\\'t care about you if they texting you while your driving. If people don\\'t put their phones to the side its going to be more deaths in car accidents.

       " \"Cellphones\\n\\nPeople should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.\\n\\nIt's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone. Events like this puts people in America in panic, especially new drivers. Also another fact actions like this as increases the death rate in America which makes the country look bad. Then it also uses a lot of our resources to repair the damage to the car or for the factory to make more cars.\\n\\nCar accidents are expensive to not just the people but also to their car insurance. Being in a car accident can affect your money which isn't a good if you're the type of person that having a hard time in life. People don't think about the consequences just by texting and driving. That person that caused the accident just by taking his eyes off the road could take a life or ruin someone's life. I believe that people don't need phones while their driving unless it's being used for good reason, like for example the GPS. Anything else shouldn't be allowed to protect the people and keep our taxes from going up because of these rates.                  \",\n",

Although using a phone for an emergency is different. There are many ways on how to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Laws have been passed to prevent horrible things happening to people while texting and driving.\\n\\nPhones and Driving would never go along with each other, it's a bad idea. In doing so half of the time a driver would use their cell phone to use social media or something that is not important and can be done on their spare time. Many accidents have happened before the world's countries have put up laws to regulate the use of a cell phone while driving. It's a huge distraction back then not many accidents occurred but many fatalities did. I believe that it is very useful to use a cellphone to navigate but there's a way in doing so.\\n\\nEmergencies can occur at any moment and anytime without knowing when it will happen we can't control that. Even though tragic things can happen it is best to stay off your phone to avoid causing major or tragic problems. A simple glimpse at your phone can make you lose control of the wheel anything can happen. It is better to pull over if necessary to stay safe and keep those around you safe as well.\\n\\nCountries and states around the world have this as a problem of people getting distracted easily by a phone. It has been a hard process to regulate this till this day people have caused many harm. Although tickets and warnings don't really help the situation but it does stop some people. Getting punished for putting lives is not fair, nobody would want to die due to a distraction.\\n\\nIn conclusion driving and using a cell phone is not a good idea no matter the situation. Staying safe on the road is very important a little distraction is not worth crashing or a ticket or even putting others at risk. This is why I think no one should be able to operate a vehicle and use a phone there are many ways to talk on the phone with bluetooth a text message can always wait.

We should not be able to use phones while driving because not only is it against the law it also causes people to get easily distracted and lose focus on the road ahead.\\n\\nOne reason why individuals should not use phones while driving is because it can cause the lack of focus to the driver. Sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone. Not having both hands on the wheel and your eyes focused on your phone can cause a huge accident. Not only can you hurt yourself in an accident you can also hurt other individuals in other vehicles and also passengers in the car with you. For example your phone rings and you get a notification. Why reaching for your phone you can fail to notice major activities happening on the road.\\n\\nAnother reason why phones should not be used while driving. Because driving and on the phone is against the law. According to state law \" Drivers may listen to streaming music that does not include videos on the screen of their phone or device while driving but cannot touch their phones while on the road to activate or program any music streaming app.\\n\\nStreaming music that is controlled by and listened through the vehicle\\'s radio is allowed.\\n\\nDrivers who need to touch their phones to activate/program their music streaming apps must do so before getting on the road\" (\"Hands-Free Law\") .\\n\\nWhich gives people a clear understanding on what the rules and regulations and the right from wrong are about using phones while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion phones should not be used while driving. It is a distraction and can hurt others around. You can get in on accident and it can affect your whole life forever. And also using your phone while driving is against the law. Even if you want to check your phone at a stop light still don\\'t. Now the only way you can possibly answer the phone is for emergencies only and the phone must be on speaker so you can still pay attention to the road ahead.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Georgia\\'s Hands-Free Law Took Effect July 1, 2018.\" Georgia Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety, www. gahighwaysafety. org/highway-safety/hands-free-law/.

       " 'Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.\\n\\nIn essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nResponsibility of Texting and Driving\\n\\nCell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.\\n\\nDriving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.\\n\\nCell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.\\n\\nThe apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, \"Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes - burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day\" (NYP).\\n\\nThis study was done in 2017.\\n\\nPeople check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.\\n\\nIf phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.\\n\\nNot only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person\\'s reaction.\\n\\nWhen a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.\\n\\nThe only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.\\n\\nIn the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.          ',\n",
       " 'Phones, Cars\\n\\nShould people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can\\'t help.\\n\\nWe already can\\'t stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don\\'t even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on \"MythBusters\" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesn\\'t under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or \"fine print\" and they can just say oh well it\\'s like a Bluetooth but it wasn\\'t type of stuff and the court can\\'t do anything about it.\\n\\nThis is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don\\'t care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not.\\n\\nThey (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can\\'t lie, or anything even know they shouldn\\'t even if it\\'s an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn\\'t do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.\\n\\nThis is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.

       " \"A Position on Vehicles and Cell Phones\\n\\nOver the last several years, mounting evidence has suggested that paying any sort of attention to a cell phone while operating a vehicle can have disastrous consequences. However, people continue to overestimate what they are capable of, at the expense of themselves and others. What the scientific community has concluded is that the bottom line for why accidents happen is distraction. This comes in the form of anything that requires you to pay attention to things other than the road, such as a text message. Cell use may not have to be prohibited while in a vehicle per se, but certainly while operating one on an open road.\\n\\nThe largest study ever conducted on texting while driving likely also offers the best data.\\n\\nThis study is of course the one done by Zendrive, which analyzed the driving behavior of 3.1 million Americans. What this study found is that, of the people that drive, 88% use their cell phone in some capacity. What's more, this in spite of rigorous campaigns railing against distracted driving. Given the slight changes between two generations of drivers, we can assume it will take some time to get the habit worn away from most members of our society. This said, it's unlikely that legislating harder restrictions will change the amount of people who text and drive to an observably good degree. The biggest changes happen culturally, and slowly.\\n\\nThe dangers of texting while driving rival the dangers of drinking while driving. Several studies have shown in driving simulations that being distracted by a text can be as dangerous as operating a vehicle while intoxicated. A quarter of adults report that texting while driving doesn't hinder their driving performance. Any form of activity that takes attention away from the task is a costly chance.\\n\\nMultitasking is the real killer here. People aren't good at it; it's asking too much of the brain. Humans are really good at focusing on one activity at a time, and anything more than that dramatically decreases proficiency. One study from the Scientific American shows that confident multitaskers are more prone to mistakes than their non confident counterparts.\\n\\nNone of this is to say that there is never a time to use a cell phone while in a car. Just, never while driving. It's a risk with little to no reward, but given the amount of people already doing it, knowing it's a mistake, it's unlikely that legislating against it will bring about the cultural shift required to make good changes. What we can do, though, is encourage safer practices for cell phone use in vehicles. Like pulling over to make phone calls or texts.\\n\\nhttp://blog. zendrive. com/distracted-driving/\\n\\nwww. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/16884056 https://www. scientificamerican. com/article/confident-multi-taskers-are-the-most-dangerous-behind-th e-wheel/         \",\n",
       " \"Using your phone while driving is dangerous. People should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it is a hazard. People can die in car wrecks because they were on their phones while driving. People can get paralyzed by these car wrecks because of a cellphone. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.\\n\\nYour main concern while your driving is that you obey the law and don't get in any wrecks. Your cellphone should not be your main concern while you are driving because it causes wrecks because your not paying attition to the road. Most wreck are because of people on their cellphones. About 421,000 people are injured in wrecks caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving are the number one reason for wrecks in the US.\\n\\nTexting and driving has its pros and cons. One pro is that you could get a text about an emergency and you could possibly save someones life. Another pro is that if your lost then you can look up where you have to go or get directions. Some of the cons are that you can get in wrecks, get injured, and even die because you were texting and driving. You should be able to be on your phone is there is bad traffic or if your at a red light.\\n\\nHaving your phone out while your driving is illegal now because of the risks of doing so. You cant even eat or drink while driving because of the hazards. Texting and driving is no joke. It is the number one cause for wrecks in the world and it can also take your life. I think that texting and driving should be illegal because if your lost or have to text somebody you can always pull over to the side of the road and use your phone because you can put not only your life at risk, but everyone else that is in the car as well.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nPhones have become such an integral part of today's society in such a small amount of times. To the point where it is now considered surprising to not have one of these handheld devices. People are able to contact their family from miles away, check up on the weather, and even entertain themselves on their by watching videos or playing games. However, it isn't all good. Phones become entertaining to the point of distraction. Most of the world having to come up with new rules and laws for these devices and anything like them. 26% of the population getting into car accidents from being distracted by their phones from texting ('How Many Car Accidents Are Caused by Cellphones?' by Bay and Associates). Question is, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving in any capacity? Especially with the rise of their popularity and use with each generation?\\n\\nPhones should be continued to be used by drivers in most capacities. Not everything should be allowed to continue or be taken off of the law, like the use of any social media or texting for example, because a phone has more uses than that. Texting if obviously the main thing we blame car accidents on, but sometimes it's more than that. Social media platforms can lead to distractions as well. Snapchat, a picture/video media platform led to a girl taking a photo in her car only to crash not even 20 minutes later back in April 2019 ('Teen who drove 106mph, used Snapchat in crash that killed friend is going to prison.' by Noah Feit). While things like that are horrible they shouldn't be banned completely while driving. If someone gets lost on their road they can always use google maps to get back home to said person's families. Maybe a family member or close friend is having an emergency, medical or otherwise, and tries to call up that person but they can't say anything due to their phone being banned. Leaving the Family member/friend to be alone or call someone else.\\n\\nThere is also the fact that not all car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Yes. It is a leading cause, but there are plenty of other causes of car accidents ('Top 15 Causes Of Car Accidents And How You Can Prevent Them.' by Elizabeth Laiza King). There are the causes that is more human error. There is distracted driving, drinking and driving, speeding, running a red light, etc. Then there are the more natural causes that could happen to even the most innocent, careful and law abiding citizens. Rain and potholes being a good couple of them. Just imagine driving in the rain at night and up the street is a pothole that you can barely make out. Oh, but there could be a solution to these problems to reduce car crashes! Ban all of them. A good idea on paper, but impossible to do and succeed without any car accidents ever again. Obviously you can't ban rain from open roads, and car accidents caused by drinking happens more often than not.\\n\\nAlcoholic influence and texting are two very different things. Both should be banned from driving, but banning your phone completely when driving is similar to banning a couple of bottles in the back of the car and getting in trouble for that. Even though you aren't touching them or plan on using it for later use outside of the car. The percentage of car accidents while drinking and driving being 28% ('Motor Vehicle Safety' by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Meanwhile texting and driving being only 26%. A 2% difference. Still both very dangerous things. Yet drinking and driving still isn't banned completely. Yes, it's against the law, but you are allowed to drive after a couple of drinks as long as your Blood Alcohol Concentration stays at 0.08 at the maximum ('Alcohol & Drug Info: What is BAC?' by Stanford University: Office of Alcohol Policy and Education).\\n\\nPhones as an entirety shouldn't be completely banned as long as alcohol isn't completely banned. Texting/messaging while driving should still be a concern, and shouldn't be reconsidered at all, but not everything is bad on a phone while driving. Coming into this new generation of drivers, it would be a good idea to start coming up with ways to possibly integrate these devices into driving tactics or the car itself. This way, it's possible to still get a use of a phone as well as lowering the car crash rate worldwide. Many cars coming up with this type of hands free technology. Jeep being a good example of this.          \",\n",
       " \"Electronic devices nowadays are in everyone's pockets, everyone has one, even kids.\\n\\nIn these times, it is essential to have one, even poor people can have an electronic device. With that being said they are always in people's faces everywhere you go, when we're walking, shopping, even when people are working they have their phones out, but if your job requires this it's ok. People always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasn't stuck in a phone. With that being said, the question for today is, should phones be allowed while driving in an automobile.\\n\\nI personally don't think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car, and you're using it for directions, therefore you're in a place of need for your device. Otherwise i don't think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesn't only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you. These types of fatal accidents always happen, because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive. An estimated amount of about 391,000 people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in 2017. This goes to show that you should always be careful because I am pretty sure everyone of those 300 thousand people didn't plan on getting into an accident before it happened.\\n\\nTexting and driving is dangerous, it kills hundreds of people every year, especially since there are new drivers every year. Teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most, which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high. That doesn't mean adults don't do it, I personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were driving.\\n\\nTexting, talking, or just catching up on social media, which is so irrelevant while you are driving. This person didn't learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck, and can you guess why this incident happened? It was because she was talking on her phone while it happened.\\n\\nBeing on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now. Now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road, And you don't have to hold it. Modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like it's own phone in the car, which you can operate while parked, and some features while you are driving. Society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much, because they are so preventful. We as a society are starting to put our phones down, especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while you're driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket.\\n\\nAs a driver myself I try not to use my phone while I'm moving, I personally try to wait until I'm stopped at a red light or I stop at a stop sign. If I need directions I can put the computer in my car and it'll take me to my destination the same as my phone would. If I want to send a text, I can either use Siri or just call the person and use a handsfree call. We as a society need to learn how to work around the dangers when it comes to things like this that can put our lives in danger, and random innocent people in danger also. Because if we don't preventable tragedies like these will never end.   \",\n",
       " \"Cell phones have become very popular. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive owns a cell phone. They have become a part of life. Cell phones are an asset this day and time, but they can also be very dangerous. Although cell phones are a necessity, I do not think they should be used while driving.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. You shouldn't be on your phone while driving. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People die almost every day from this. When you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths. People have a hard time with texting and driving. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.\\n\\nUsing your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving. I saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to do that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first. I do not want to cause an accident and hurt myself or someone else just to answer a call or text. That can wait.\\n\\nUsing cell phones while driving put everyone's life in danger. We don't know what the person behind the wheel is going through. There is nothing so important it can't wait. Next time you get that phone call or text while driving, wait until you stop the car to answer it. You could save your life or the life of someone else.        \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.\\n\\nThe world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.\\n\\nOn average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.\\n\\nThere are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .\\n\\nThe purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " '\"Distracted Driving is a No-Go\"\\n\\nIn a recent Google search, it was estimated that about \"1.2 billion people drive in the world\". Imagine if every driver had a cell phone, and used it while driving, this would cause a lot of distractions and possible deadly accidents. It is my belief that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nToday\\'s generation is really the most tech savvy because now people trying to use their phone while driving and it is very dangerous. Teens are very distracted by their phone and when they get a call or text they try to pick it up while driving that\\'s why people need hand free Bluetooth in their car. According to Esurance, \"cognitive or mental distraction is when a driver\\'s mind isn\\'t focused on driving. Talking to another passenger or being preoccupied with personal, family, or work-related issues are some examples.\" Teens would rather make snapchat videos then driving. While you drive put your phone on do not disturb while you drive or you put on their manual so it knows that you driving.\\n\\nSecondly, you can also can get in a deadly accident while trying to text and drive. According to an Usa Today article,\" In Houston, the driver of a pickup truck that collided with a church minibus in rural Texas, killing 13 people, apologized after the crash and acknowledged he had been texting while driving.\" People don\\'t know how dangerous it is for you text and drive, until it\\'s too late.\\n\\nIn a recent google search, it has been \"1.6 billon crashes each year by texting and driving\". Those are scary numbers!\\n\\nAlthough, they made a new law that people in Georgia can\\'t have their phones in their hands while driving. According to Alive, \"Georgia\\'s hands-free law took effect on Sunday, July 1, 2018. It is a sweeping, landmark measure that has been under consideration for several years and will affect all of us as Georgians in one way or another.\" People can\\'t send or watch a video while driving. The hand free law is all over Georgia and they trying to spread it around the world so people hold their phone at all. Even though the law is in place, I see on a daily, drivers still using their phones.\\n\\nIn the end, people shouldn\\'t use their phones while driving because it is not safe for people around the world. The law keeps the people safe and it is up to us to enforce and follow the laws to keep all drivers and passengers safe on the road.         ',\n",
       " \"Phones are equipped by everyone in today's society. Whether you are poor or rich or even in between, getting a phone seems to be the easiest thing to get your hands on. Humans use phones to keep in contact originally but now it's used for entertainment, and nowadays you can make a lot of money off of your cellular device. However people tend to use phones more often than they should now since there have been more social apps, texting etc. equipped on devices. One big issue in the overuse of phones is using them while operating a vehicle. This particularly is a big issue because people have gotten hit, and many accidents have been the result of using phones while in the car. Each year over 421,000 accidents happen every year due to texting and driving or the driver was distracted by something else on their phone as well. Driving while using your phone can be very detrimental to your life and someone else's.\\n\\nDriving is risky every time you do it, there are a lot of bad drivers out there just as much as there are good drivers out there so it is always important to be focused while you're on the road. Using a phone can be dangerous firstly because you can harm yourself or someone else as a result of not being aware while you're driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2017 there were 34,439 crashes and 9% of the crashes involved a distracted driver and 486 fatalities were as a result of these crashes with a cell phone in use. Also reports from the National Safety Council also say that if you are on your phone while you're driving then you are 6 times more likely to get into an accident then a drunk driver. These situations can affect both you and somebody else if you hit another car or just somebody crossing the street.\\n\\nNobody wants to go to court or be present in a court of law, especially for something like being on your phone while driving. Being on your phone while driving is a moving traffic violation and may go down as a criminal misdemeanor. Also depending on what state you're in you can pay fines for being on your phone while driving. For example in Georgia you pay $150 for being on your phone while driving but in other states such as California with the smallest fee you'd have to pay with only $20, however in Alaska with the highest fee you'd have to pay up to $10,000 and you'd have to do a year in prison as well. This can also go on your record if the state you live in has phone use while driving as a Moving traffic Violation. For this to be the repercussions of using your phone while driving, I'm telling you it's not worth it.\\n\\nFinally Texting and Driving can also lead you to Prison. In the previous paragraphs I spoke on the fines and fatality statistics. In Alaska you can pay an additional $10,000 with a year in prison included and there were 486 fatalities in 2017 alone. Whether your texting or on social media while driving these distractions can end up hurting someone else more then you and this can lead you to the penitentiary even if it was an accident. In 2015 nearly 4,000 deaths occured due to distracted drivers another 3,450 were in the year 2016. This is a serious crime and people who have hit and killed people because they were distracted drivers can face up to 20 years in prison due to casualties from them being distracted. To play it safe the phone shouldn't be used while driving so no one gets hurt.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, being on your phone while driving is very dangerous for both you and people around you. This can be very detrimental to your record and you could be charged huge fines depending on where you live, you're not going to see many people in Alaska doing this. These accidents and casualties are preventable if drivers have the self control to only use their phones when there not driving their car. However maybe another way to fix it is if everyone had to pay the $10,000 like in Alaska, that may seem like a lot but someone loosing their life is worth way more.   \",\n",

       " 'Cell phone use and driving has been a highly discussed topic in the past ten years. While cell phone use is almost unanimous, the danger of being distracted while driving has lead many states to ban the use of hand held cell phones while in the car. Passing laws that require hands free devices such as blue tooth to keep your attention on the road. While it is not a guarantee that this is totally safe it lowers the risk of loosing focus while driving. This is due to how our brain codes information and how we attend to certain stimuli. While driving we are taking in constant visual stimuli, for example when you are driving you see a red light and stop. While driving mmight become slightly autonomous over time, attentive and working memory resources are being used to watch the road. While you are physically looking at your phone when texting, you are also using mental resources to decode and sort what you are seeing. This means that even when you look up you could still be distracted from the road because your attentional resources are being split up between the phone and driving. Contrary to common belief there is no such thing as \"multitasking\". The brain cannot preform two tasks at the same time; it however switches between each task. Cell Phone Use and Driving: A Deadly Combination In the world today, society suffers from cell phone addiction. People everywhere use some sort of mobile device constantly. This addiction on its own, while still negative, becomes especially dangerous when combined with driving. While driving, cell phones create many distractions. Some of these distractions include: dialing on the phone, answering the phone, simply talking on the phone, and texting. These distractions constantly increase with all of the new technology available today. The smart phones in every adult and teenagers \\' pockets prove deadly when used on the road. According to a government website, \"In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver\" (Distracted Driving). Although various disturbances exist while driving, cell phone usage has proved a fatal but preventable distraction.   ',\n",
       " 'Phone and Driving Essay\\n\\nDrivers should not text and drive because it can lead to various life threatening situations.\\n\\nAccording to research, it shows that we should not text and drive because texting and driving can cause a lot of distraction, such as car accidents, running someone over, running a red light and a lot more bad accidents. Many people had lost their lives while texting and driving, especially teenagers because they are young, careless and reckless and also easily distracted. Texting while driving can lead to a lot of nasty death, according to an article I read online a few years back reminded me that texting while driving can cause a lot of damages, such as life threatening damages, harm to public safety, getting a ticket, and even crashing and killing yourself, this is why most states around the US came up with a new law that can get you arrested or given a ticket for texting and driving. Although this law has been passed a lot of people still text and drive which is not good for the public safety. For example\\n\\nIncluding kids has been killed by reckless drivers and some of those drivers usually get away without any injuries or jail time and this is not fair to the victims families. Before you think about grabbing a phone to text and drive you should think about the victims family and you should also think about your own life, because you only have one life to live so you think twice before you put yourself in a place or position that will harm yourself.\\n\\n(Theme) Do not text and drive.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nShould humans be allowed to use their cellar device while driving a truly age old question. People should be able to use their phone only if they have a car mount and are trying to use the GPS in my opinion. Otherwise pull to the side of the road if you just have to send a call or text. I truly don\\'t understand what is that indispensable that you have to risk not only your life but others lives by picking up your phone. Just pull in to your local fast food or store and send that text that will (I assume) complete your life.\\n\\nYou know people have got seriously injured doing it ........\\n\\nIt\\'s crazy the number of people that have died by texting and driving. Just in 2013 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Even more telling The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. (1.6!!)\\n\\nNearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\\n\\n1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nTexting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that\\'s enough time to travel the length of a football field.\\n\\nTexting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. These are few stats that support my thesis but the stories hit closer to home for me the story of seven year old Xzavier is particularly disturbing A driver who allegedly was texting behind the wheel hit seven-year-old Xzavier Davis-Bilbo, dragging him nearly 20 feet in the process. The crash paralyzed Xzavier, and he spent four and a half months in the intensive care unit.\\n\\nHe won\\'t ever walk again. That young man was only seven nowhere close to the prime years of his life. Know he can\\'t play sports, run to the bus stop, or even jump up for a high-five because somebody was \"allegedly\" distracted by their phone.\\n\\nBut I can keep control i\\'m not them If it\\'s one thing I know I know that people always think they can do something until they are proven wrong. Don\\'t be that person this isn\\'t a game this is literally life or death. Just because you haven\\'t hit anyone yet doesn\\'t mean your a celestial being at driving you have just been lucky. Other counter arguments might say but what I just need to do one little thing for work or school. Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what\\'s worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn conclusion t\\'s now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia, part of a sweeping hands-free law that went into effect Sunday. Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rules even tapping \"play\" on a Apple playlist while not parked face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second time getting caught. The law, signed by Gov. Nathan Deal in May, aims to curtail driving fatalities in the state. So even if you believe a astounding driver you\\'ll go to jail so just pull over.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHafner, Josh. \"Drop That Phone: It\\'s Now Illegal to Hold Your Mobile Device While Driving in Georgia.\" USA Today, Gannett Satellite Information Network, 3 July 2018, www. usatoday. com/story/news/nation-now/2018/07/02/georgia-hands-free-law-bans-holding-phone-while-driving/752752002/.\\n\\n\"Real Stories of Texting and Driving Deaths That Will Make Teens Think Twice.\" TeenSafe, 12 July 2018, www. teensafe. com/blog/real-stories-texting-and-driving-deaths-teens/.\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, Edgar Snyder &amp; Associates, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html.\\n\\n3            ',\n",

Many accidents have been reported due to this. Using a phone while driving is dangerous and a huge risk.\\n\\nThe road requires your full-undivided attention. When using your phone while driving you then decrease the amount of attention you give to the road and your attention then is put into the phone. Drivers can sometimes get sidetracked and loose focus on the road when using a phone. It is easy to for an accident to happen. According to Teen Driver Source , \"Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving\". This proves that the attention span is removed from the road onto one\\'s phone.\\n\\nThe road is a very busy place where a lot happens and if you don\\'t make the right move, it can end up very badly. Not everyone can handle being able to divide their attention within the road and their phone. As it states in What Are the Dangers of Texting While Driving , \" a lot of the danger lies. With so many people on the road using highly distracting devices, the potential for accidents-and thus injuries and fatalities-is incredibly high.\" This shows that statically that texting while driving is harmful in many ways.\\n\\nTexting while driving reports shot as new technology increased. Proving that driving while using these new technologies was a disadvantage. According to Texting and Driving Accident Statistics ,1/4 accidents happens because of one\\'s interaction with a cell phone. This a huge chunk in these accident statics proving the fact that interacting with a cell phone is dangerous and should not be allowed.\\n\\nDriving while texting is not a good match, leading into many different and dangerous accidents. There are so many accidents that has been reported due to texting/ interacting with one\\'s phone that it is safe to say that Drivers should NOT be able to use cell phones when on the road.

       " '\"Phones And Driving\"\\n\\nA common killer in america today is driving while looking at your cell phone. Drivers feel like it is more important to see who texted them instead of looking at the road which causes fatal accidents. Drivers must keep the eyes on the road to look for issues and problems in the road or to see if the light is green. Which as why there are campaigns supporting no driving while texting movement with a speech \"It can wait\" signifying that any text that comes through your phone can wait.\\n\\nIn 2015, reportedly 391,000 injuries were caused from drivers looking at cell phones and texting while driving. The statistics shows that drivers should never be allowed to look down at their phone while driving and if caught the driver should receive a ticket. Not only are you putting yourself in danger but others as well when look down for even one second the consequences will be fatal.\\n\\nFurthermore, the \"It can wait\" campaign started by the phone company AT&T in 2010 to raise awareness by spreading this message. This message was put on billboards, tv commercials, and cereal boxes. A phone company wanted drivers to know that looking at your cell phone while driving can wait for when you are not driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be able to look at their phones while driving. For it can prove quite dangerous and fatal if its done. The the text can wait until the vehicle is not is parked in a suitable parking spot. Drivers should not even have look at the phone the phone should be out of reach and out of sight of the driver while they are driving\\n\\nSources: https://www. teensafe. com/distracted-driving/100-distracted-driving-facts-and-statistics-2018/\\n\\nhttps://fleishmanhillard. com/work/att-can-wait-power-movement/   ',\n",
       " \"The use of cell phones are important to teens, children, and even adults in everyday life. Although sometimes it may be dangerous to use cellular devices while you drive, we also need them for important decisions. These reasons vary in situations where we have calls, GPS, or even change the song that you might not want to listen to at the time. Therefore, the use of cellphones while one is driving is important.\\n\\nA GPS (global positioning system), helps lots of us drivers pinpoint our location, and take us from one place to another. However sometimes, we may need to change our destinations or even stop the route while under the control of a vehicle. For example, say if a lady was driving to a destination, and she started to change the location because she typed in the wrong one, that would be a good reason as to why us humans should be able to use our phones while we drive. Without us being able to use our phones to do so while we drive, we could all possibly end up at different places than we expected to be. This can go as far as to restaurants, stores, and different people houses.\\n\\nPhone calls from our family, friends, and even ones who you work with are important to pick up while you're driving. To help out with these situations, you have equipment that can be placed on your window so you won't have to look away from the street to answer your device. For example, if you're receiving an important call, and you are aware that you cannot look away, this object will help you and make it easier for you to be on your phone. By doing this, this can reduce the chance of injuries and accidents by allowing someone to focus on the road and a important call at the same time.\\n\\nUsing your phone to change songs on the radio or your own device is significant. For example, you can have kids in the car and the song might have inappropriate words for them. Because of that, you may have to use your phone to change songs if it is off the device. Also, if the person doesn't want to listen to the songs that are playing, then the need for someone to be able to use their phone while driving is important to us.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the needs that we have to access our phones while driving is necessary. If we weren't able to answer calls, use the GPS, change music with the object then things would be different. We could have emergencies and problems that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. Therefore, the human race should be able to use their phones while driving to accomplish these needs. If car manufactures could make the hands free device more safe for us drivers, everybody should be able to use their phone while driving.                          \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is of the most common ways people die or get others killed in America. With this problem, nobody thinks that it could be them that's dead and on the news from using their phone while driving. There are countless reasons why this needs to come to an end in our society.\\n\\nMany states have acted on the matter and have a hands free ban while driving. Nobody ever needs to use their phone while driving, you are supposed to be concentrated at all times while behind the wheel. One of the main reasons people are still disregarding this rule is because they're using their phone most times throughout the day and can't be without even while driving. The National safety council reports that phone use while driving causes approximately 1.6 crashes in a single year, also that 1 in every 4 car crashes has to do with phone usage while driving. Laws that were placed on these problems are slowly but surely getting rid of this problem over time.\\n\\nEverybody across the nation should tell their loved ones that it is never safe to do so and should attempt to stop this by any means necessary. Nobody wants to see any friends or family taken away from them by something that could easily be fixed. Act today and be the voice that can save many lives, including your friends and family .   \",\n",
       " \"Driving with and without the use of a cell phone:\\n\\nNowadays when you are walking or even driving you see a lot of people with a smartphone, that's because 61.62% of our population has one. There are a lot of reasons why people are on their cellphones while driving. As well there are pros and cons of driving while texting. Throughout many years the stats of accidents while on their phone has also increased.\\n\\nEach year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.\\n\\nAs to all the things there are pros and cons, but in this topic, there are cons and thoughts what people think are pros. Nowadays technology is an everyday usage, us being away or not checking our phones consistently makes us feel the need to be plugged in. The majority of the scenes where people do this act end up in a car crash. Hurting yourself or even getting killed is not the only danger you take, you also put other peoples life in danger. In some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly, or even kill them. Remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment, you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds. Some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. There are also many more reasons why people are on their phone.\\n\\nEvery person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call. That important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple minutes while you get to somewhere safe. Risking your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it. People around you that care about you, will truly understand that you couldn't answer in that exact moment.                                \",\n",
       " \"Texting & Driving\\n\\nEveryday around the United States studies show that one out of ten people are killed by drivers that are distracted by their phones and about 1500 are critically injured. One of the most dangerous and distracting things you could possibly do is texting while driving. It is very dangerous because people who text and drive are putting extra attention onto their phone and that takes away their sight of the road which raises the chances of that person losing control of the vehicle which can cause a fatal crash that can injure the driver, injure another person or even kill the person. When a person is using their phone, their thinking about everything else besides concentrating on their surroundings and driving.\\n\\nThe statistics are very poor, because according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in 2011 3,331 were involved in car accidents and unfortunately died because of a distracted driver on his phone, and 387,000 were severely hurt in vehicle crashes. Also according to a recent search by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute revealed that drivers who are looking at their phones are twice as likely to crash or come close to crashing than those who are paying attention to the road. These statistics are becoming more regular as people start to use their phone more and more everyday, especially those of younger ages.\\n\\nFor this reason it is extremely that we find different ways to terminate this terrible habit of texting and driving. To me I think that one of the best ways to cut this habit is to just turn off your phone while driving. Doing this will keep the driver focused on the road and not the buzzing and ringing the phone makes, this will also stop the driver from texting. Another way is that there are actually apps that can disable your phone while you're driving and another app that can text that person and tell them that you're driving and you'll text them back later. These are some great apps that we can use to our advantage and stop our habits of texting and driving. A great way to stop looking at your phone is that if you have a friend or another person in the car, have them check the phone while you're driving so you don't have too.\\n\\nSomething that is highly important is that a lot of the states have begun to pass a couple laws that orders drivers to completely stop texting and driving. But we need to be profound: none of these laws will work efficiently if the people of the society don't understand that texting while driving could have immaculate consequences, not only for the people driving but also other bystanders and innocent people. In my opinion I don't think that answering your phone is more important than your life and other people's lives. Using your phone can wait until you get where you need to be.     \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn this age of the world almost everyone has a phone of some kind and this includes drivers among us. Phones usually are a little distraction nothing more, but when they are driving that distraction can become deadly. In recent years the fatalities by car wreck have gone up dramatically and usually the reason these days is texting while driving. In most states if you are caught you will have some sentence or a fine of some kind. It doesn\\'t even have to be texting that distracts a person from driving, it can be from kids in the car to the radio.\\n\\nIn the state of georgia there is a pretty new law called the \"hands free law\"which tells drivers that they can\\'t even touch their phones while driving. When drivers are not parked even at stoplights if their caught on their phones they will get a fifty dollar fine. The law makers made this in mind to make people not take any selfies or videos or anything like that. In reality people will try even harder and be more reckless to try and do the videos their doing. On the other hand though they say that dash cams are ok to use.\\n\\nHowever, there are exceptions to this law such as using stereo bluetooth speakers in the car with spotify. Another exception they make is for directions apps like google maps. They also make exceptions for informing the authorities about a crime or something similar. While they said we can listen to music or streams or stuff like that we can\\'t touch our phones while doing so. Given these reasons i don\\'t think that drivers should be able to use their phones while driving.\\n\\n1            ',\n",
       " \"Required Essay: Phones & Driving\\n\\nThere are many reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving vehicle. First of all, it can be very dangerous using cell phones while driving. Because when you use cell phone you get distracted with other things you are doing and things around you. When you are driving your focus should be in driving not in your phone or in any other things. There are high chances of you getting into an accident. Furthermore, getting in an accident that might really affect your bank balance and you don't want that. For example, when you hit a car in accident and if it's your fault you have to pay for that person's car repairing and for that person's medical also your insurance will go higher. That will really affect your bank balance. Lastly, I have seen and read most of the people who gets in an accident they are teenagers. Teenagers they keep using phones and driving in the same times that's how most of that accident happens. If you don't care about your own life there is more people who cares about you especially your parents. So at least Think about them before doing something. So there are my top three reasons why no one should use phones while driving.   \",\n",
       " \"In the world we live in, everyone has a cell phone. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. They should not because it is a distraction, and the call or text can wait.\\n\\nThe call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.\\n\\nCell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.\\n\\nIn conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.   \",\n",

Since the creation of phones it has made it easier to connect with a person. People also like the ability of being reached within seconds. With phones increasing there been an increase in automobile accidents. Although people think that phones are necessary for emergency people do not focus while driving. Phones are the main reason for automobile accidents, and it distracts the person while driving.\\n\\nPhones have been the major cause of automobile accidents. Since it distracts the driver from the road. While using a phone it becomes harder for the driver to be completely focus. There have been studies that indicate that phones leads to crashes. \"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\" (Snyder, 2002). It shows how people\\'s awareness and concentration decrease while being on their phone. It distracts drivers and causes them to not pay attention in moving traffic.\\n\\nEven though there are many reasons for using a phone while driving there are some benefits. The main benefit is the ability of communicating within seconds. It also gives people security having a phone. In an emergency, \"having a cell phone can allow help to reach yo quickly and could possibly save lives\" (Kingston, 2019). Phone help with being connected with others. Also it makes it easier for people to send their location in an emergency. With modern phones it becomes easier to find their exact location.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this paper has talked about both sides of the use of phones and not using phones while driving. Even though phones give people security it also unfocus the person while driving. If people keep using phone it would increase automobile accidents.

This way we have a safer environment for everyone.

       " 'Do you think drivers should use their phone at any capacity while driving? Some people may think different but I think it\\'s very dangerous. There have been 3,153 injuries, and 424,000 deaths dealing with texting while driving. Texting while driving has been happening all over the world, and for many many years since the cell phone has been made. It also takes away the perception of the road meaning everyone would be taking their eyes off the road. Social media is another liability while texting in the car.\\n\\nHaving the phone while driving has been a daily part of life since the phone was invented in 1972. Texting while driving has been a part of daily life since messaging was put into use on the cell phone. People urge to text and drive because once they get that first text they don\\'t want to stop replying. \"Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have fueled a spike in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past two years\".\\n\\nPeople don\\'t understand the dangers and necessities of keeping your eyes on the road, because the death rate continues to go up and on one care to change it.\\n\\nThere are many different types of phones all across the world not even in the United States alone. \"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 80% of all car crashes are related to driver inattention\". There are overall seven state with bans on cell phones in the hand while driving. No one understands why everyone all over the world desires to keep their phone in their hand at all times be it always happens. Even when there is a passenger in the car for example a Jamaican man and his family he would sometimes still text and drive if he wife weren\\'t in the car.\\n\\nNo one can see while you\\'re looking at your phone that\\'s the reason while everyone is crashing on the road now a days. Texting is in one of the top ten categories of the most dangerous causes of death in the U.S lone. Technology in vehicles are causing drivers to be on the phone as well taking their eyes off the road. Looking at your phone cause the driver to either hit a bystander or an animal. \"Statistics state that on average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to distracted driving\".\\n\\nNo matter what everyone should just put the phone down while driving because everyone would be even more safe.\\n\\nIn conclusion there are many different views on whether the phone should be allowed in the car while driving. There are many problems with phones being in cars and since it has been made accidents are still going to happen. Cars are being totaled, lives are being lost, and people are being injured because of phone and driving. Sometimes many would think if the phone wasn\\'t invented would the death rate have stayed the same or would everything be different. Phones don\\'t need to have that big of an impact of people\\'s lives because that\\'s not good or healthy for any body\\'s life. Phone shouldn\\'t be allowed in these days, or the future of any body\\'s hands in a car because of all the risks and what has happened in the past.       ',\n",
       " 'Ever since cell phones became popular in the late 1990\\'s, in America, they have evolved from being simple mobile dialing and answering machines to basically mini computers that allow humans to now do a multitude of things like surf the internet and bank online to name a few. Unfortunately, in rent years humans have used cell phones to answer and receive calls, text and surf the Internet.\\n\\nAs a result, cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deaths.\\n\\nIn my opinion, drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand, however, they should be allowed to use cell phones in \"hands free\" mode as follows while operating a vehicle:\\n\\n1. to talk and/or talk text via Bluetooth, 2. to use maps and/or a navigation system and 3. for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies, especially during cross county travel.\\n\\nTalking and texting while driving has become a \"hot topic\" in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking and/or texting. I will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their hands.\\n\\nI will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road. However, a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use \"hands free\" mode via Bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your hands.\\n\\nBefore the cell phone, humans used actual paper maps to navigate the world.\\n\\nUntil the early 2000\\'s when cell phones came with satellite navigation via Goggle maps, software and apps such as MapQuest and Waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phone.\\n\\nNavigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their hands.\\n\\nHowever, there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps, therefore resulting in a traffic accidents. A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the \"hands free\" mode while using navigation systems.\\n\\nThe Internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stations.\\n\\nThe Internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phone.\\n\\nThe Internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as YouTube and Netflix.\\n\\nMusic has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distracted.\\n\\nHowever, movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while driving.\\n\\nA solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all \"hands free\" solutions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of \"hands free\" mode while operation a vehicle.\\n\\nThe actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents, it is basically the user lacking concentration, not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents.\\n\\nAlthough humans will still get into traffic accidents while using \"hands free\" mode while operation a vehicle, it will most certainly cut down the number of accidents in the United States and around the world.

       " 'Cell phones Privileges\\n\\nCell phones have been around for years but just in the past few they have become hazardous, due to people using them in cars while operating them. They have cause death, serious injuries, and damage to personal and government property. I believe phones should not be used in vehicles without a hand-free Bluetooth system or passenger who can speak while you focus on what\\'s in front of you. There\\'s no age group or sex that hasn\\'t been the cause of an accident due to their cell phones. There are many reasons technology shouldn\\'t be allowed in vehicles while behind the wheel. There just as bad as drinking and driving. Cellphones are not okay while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nSince technology has took thousands are at risk of crashing and dying. \"The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. Texting while driving is a contributing cause in 25% of all car accidents - resulting in almost 400,000 physical injuries. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving.\" Phones have caused a chaotic distraction across America. How many more people must die before we give up on using cell phones and driving.\\n\\nNot only does this distraction of cellphones while driving kill, but its costing a fortune of money that doesn\\'t help our economy. \"Distracted Driving and Its Economic Impact Highway crashes cost $871 billion a year - $277 billion in physical damage and another $594 billion in \"societal harm,\" such as traffic congestion and lost productivity, according to the agency.\" Our country is trillions of dollars in debt and this doesn\\'t help. Over one and half trillion dollars is because of distracted drivers.\\n\\nThere thousands of reasons that you should not be able to use your cellphone while driving. However, hands free cellphone Bluetooth or headset is okay if you\\'re not getting distracted. I have proven the main harmful impacts of users on there cellphones while driving. It is hazardous, costly. and it kills not to mention police have writing tens of thousands of tickets annually, but the total number of summons written has dropped and risen over the past five years, according to the state Judiciary. These are many reason I believe you shouldn\\'t be able to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle of any kind.         ',\n",
       " \"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours an average of 660,000 people are using electronic devices while driving. People from ages 16-24 are mostly involved in car accidents having to do with texting and driving.\\n\\nWhen you text and drive you put not only your life at risk, but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.\\n\\nTexting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing a death. When you text and drive you are distracted and are not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving is bad and also illegal.\\n\\nAdditionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving does not need to occur. do not do anything else in your car besides paying attention to the road and having both of your hands on the steering wheel. People around the world need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in. too many people di because others are too worried about their phones instead of the people around them.    \",\n",
       " \"Phone & Driving\\n\\nPeople are constantly using their phones for different things. There are many great uses for phones. We use them for work, to contact some, even to watch videos and school research. Phones are one thing we tend to keep in our hands. However this hasn't proven to be to the best choice. NHTSA say that at least 1000 people are injured because of phone usage while driving a vehicle. In this paper I will be talking about why I think we shouldn't use cellphones while driving.\\n\\nIt has been proven that cell phone usage leads to deaths. Motor vehicles crash daily and usually there are many fatalities as a result of cell phone usage. Most accidents are caused by teen drivers that just have to pick up their phone while driving. The main casualties are pedestrians. In the year of 2018 alone, around 400,000 people were injured or killed. It is sad that lives are destroyed by one senseless act such as picking up a phone while driving.\\n\\nDrivers that are seen and caught risk very serious punishment. The average cellphone while driving violation cost about $300 per incident. This violation also comes with a minimum of four points towards your license. This can cost you in other ways as well such as higher insurance premiums. Once you receive fifteen points your license is revoked and you are now left with finding other means of transportation. If you are found guilty of hitting someone you can face one to twenty years in prison. One second of picking up a cellphone may lead to lifetime of misery.\\n\\nDriving while using a cellphone may lead to a lifelong change with many effects.\\n\\nImagine for just one moment a teen has friends or even siblings in the car with them; suddenly the phone rings. The teen looks away from the road to answer or check the text message, hits a pothole, loses control of the vehicle and in now in oncoming traffic. The vehicle crashes killing some of the passenger if not all involved.\\n\\nYou now have several different families that have been united by a tragedy that shouldn't have been. Drivers in the oncoming traffic may be injured as well and now have a lifetime of bills or life changing injuries and scars to hunt them of the day that some teen made a conscious choice to pick up a cellphone and drive. One moment is all it ever takes to change a life.\\n\\nAs you can see from the research people are affected by distracted drivers. You risk serving jail time and giving up your freedom. You can lower the causalities by simple not operating your vehicle while on a cellphone. People would worry less and feel safer if they were assured that you are being responsible and choose not to text or talk while driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nGoogle. com NHTSA.com DMV.com         \",\n",
       " 'Required Essay: Phones & Driving\\n\\nStarting in the 1996, cell phones became very important to people\\'s everyday life. Cell phones started as huge bulky items that were not able to fit in a pocket. Now, they are an everyday item that is carried in someone\\'s pocket, purse, etc. After they became wireless they played a ever bigger role in life. Cell phones were starting to be used in cars for GPS and playing music through bluetooth. People started to take advantage of using a cell phone while driving and things went down from there. People should be able to use their cell phones while driving for navigation to wherever they are going , to contact anyone for an emergency, and hands free answering phone calls.\\n\\nGPS navigation system is one of the main reason people use their cell phones while driving. If driving from Georgia to New York with a map or using road signs, because you can\\'t use cell phones while driving, you are going to make a lot of mistakes and many u-turns. Using a cell phone for navigation is the best way to get to your destination the fastest and easiest. According to Baldwin Ellis, \" Cell phones allow users to call for directions when they cannot find their destinations. Furthermore, many cell phones have GPS technology that provide turn-by-turn directions to any destination and maps that provide real-time traffic information.\" (Ellis). This shows that GPS navigation on cell phones are helpful to show real information going on around the area and send you a better route. While using the GPS you can also talk on the phone while GPS gives you directions on where to go at the same time.\\n\\nMost people like to talk to people on the phone while driving. Whenever your phone rings it\\'s an instinct to go reach for it and pick it up. It\\'s more safe to listen and talk to the person on the phone through the car than holding the phone up to your ear and driving with one hand. With bluetooth in a car, you wouldn\\'t be breaking the hands free law. According to \" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car\" article, \"the Bluetooth capabilities you end up with will save you from receiving a ticket and also making it easier for you to keep your hands on the wheel.\". This shows that bluetooth is the key to not breaking any law your state made about hands free. Using Bluetooth can also help with texting and driving. Instead of picking up your phone and texting some back, you can use bluetooth the say your message and send text out loud. According to \" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car\" article, \"Many offer Bluetooth capabilities, which will help to alleviate the temptation of manually texting.\" . Don\\'t even think of reach for your phone when you hear you got a text just get Bluetooth in your car. It\\'s better to get bluetooth than being in a car accident for texting and driving.\\n\\nYou will need your phone while driving if something serious happened or is happening and you need emergency services quick. Without your phone, you would be stuck out on the road during the day or even night with no one to help. Most people definitely don\\'t like to stop for people even when they see they\\'re in trouble. According to \"NHTSA\\'s Office of Emergency Medical Services\" , \"emergency telephone calls presented to the switchboard in May 2017 was 845,674, an average of 27.3 thousand per day.\". This shows that many people use their phone to call EMS when any type of situation or car crash happens.\\n\\nAs you can see driving with your phone is not bad at all unless you make it bad. Although people make using cell phones bad, it\\'s very helpful to everyday things you do in a car. You wouldn\\'t like to sit in silence not knowing where to go and then suddenly your car breaks down and you don\\'t know what else to do. Cell phones are needed in everyday life. Why try and take that from us just because we are in a car, but there are ways to help prevent anything going bad while using them while driving.         ',\n",
       " 'Is a reading a message more important than you life?\\n\\nTexting and driving why is people putting their lives and other people lives in danger to read a message. We will have to find a understanding of why people are texting and driving when it\\'s against the law. Texting and driving started to evolve around 2013 and it also has become a huge distraction to those who can not stay off their phones. Some texting and driving accidents occurs almost every hour. Just last year the cell phone being used while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually. Also texting and driving causes more accidents then driving under the influence.\\n\\nI believe people really don\\'t think they can get into a car accident since they want to read and texting people back. Not only that you putting your life other the line you putting other people lives on the line. Plus it\\'s against the law to text and drive also it has been banned in 47 states. The fine of texting and driving is $20 to $400 dollars. In the world right now 660,000 people attempt to use their phones while texting a driving but once again the cell phones distraction is alarmly high so they is a 75 percent chance that they will be on they phone the entire time while their driving then they try to hide their phone when the police ride past..\\n\\nEverybody was or has used their phone while texting and driving but only a few has been caught everywhere around the world. Reasons why accidents occurs because the moment you look away you stop paying attention to the road. So you don\\'t know if another car or person is coming down the street but the moment you look back up from your phone then it\\'s too late. Example last year during my junior year we had a speaker come in and he told us how he lost his 6 year old daughter due to somebody texting and driving. He said \"the person that killed my babygirl would never know how this feels i almost lost both of my kids but i lost the youngest one\" You really should think and care about if you should be texting and driving because you can end lives and crush that person heart if you killed somebody in the wreck also you will go to jail for reckless driving. . If you know somebody that\\'s always text and drive ask them if the care about their life. It don\\'t matter if they\\'re driving to school, work, the store, or even up the street. Losing a love is the worst feeling you can possibly deal with. Always try to help a friend or family because everyday is not promised so you try to help them instead of them risking their life by texting and driving.\\n\\nIt\\'s going to be a time where a loved one experiences a texting and driving or either is involved in and texting and driving accident. There is a 50% chance that and texting and driving accident will take someones life. That\\'s why it is best if you do not touch your phone while driving and make sure that you seatbelt is on. Like you see on billboards it be left unread than dead because it always a high chance of an texting and drive accident. Therefore don\\'t be a victim of the texting and driving just wait till its a good time to use your phone then text them back.            ',\n",

Car crashes are the main cause of death for teens considering texting and driving is over five times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving. With the increase in people who text and drive the risk of being on the road also increases.\\n\\nDistracting driving is the cause of over half of all car accidents and is most commonly found in ages 16-19. Parents need to be teaching their children the importance of staying focused behind the wheel. Parents need to make sure that their kids are staying safe on the roads and safe around other drivers. There are multiple car trackers that parents can access to track their kids on the roads and some parents even prohibit taking a phone while driving\\n\\nFuture generations are continuing to text and drive regardless to the numerous laws restricting distracted driving. A lot of teens continue to text and drive even though most of them are familiar with their states driving laws. However, most teens are not aware that distracted driving is more dangerous than drinking and driving and fail to see that their phones reduce their reaction speed and hand eye coordination behind the wheel.\\n\\nIf the countless driving laws that restrict texting and driving don't stop you from checking your phone behind the wheel then think about the risk you are putting on yourself and all the drivers around you. For a lot of drivers who struggle staying off their phone, they can start off by simply turning off their phone and putting it in the console. Other features like Bluetooth and do not disturb mode also help drivers keep their eyes on the road.\\n\\nSo if you ´re thinking about responding to your friend while driving, just simply wait until you have time to respond. There is no point in risking you and everyone around you over a stupid text. Just turn the phone off and wait until you ´re done driving to ensure the safety of all drivers and decrease the risk of a fatal accident.   \",\n",

Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but to all of the cars surrounding the person that is driving the vehicle. In agreement with many people, texting and driving is similar, if not Identical to drunk driving. Using your cellular device impairs your vision and causes you to lose focus on the road. We as a nation should make stricter laws enforcing \"No texting and driving\" or creating a system that disables your phone the moment you pull out of the driveway.\\n\\nEven though texting and driving is a well-known known issue our young and older adult are blind to the consequences of it. As a result of texting becoming so popular, the percentage rate of the deaths due to these types of accidents have rapidly increased. Texting and Driving puts so many unknowing people at risk. People think that being connected to other is more important than focusing on the road ahead. While being behind the wheel of a moving vehicle, drivers should never direct their attention to their cellphones or any other mobile device.\\n\\nTexting can be extremely hazardous when you are behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. Texting and driving is most frequent in young adults. The dangers of texting and driving results in the increase of deaths annually, because texting is so popular.

Thousands of people are killed or injured in accidents because someone had to send one more text or take one more picture. Imagine if a loved one left there house to visit for supper, and the never arrived. You would be terrified, then you get a call to be told that they have been in an accident. Of course it was by a young man distracted by his cell phone. People should not be allowed to be on there at all, not for any reason.\\n\\nThere are three types of distractions manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when your hands are off the wheel and not being used to drive safely, visual distraction is when your eyes are not on the road and are instead on your cell phone, last a cognitive distraction refers to taking your mind of driving and being more focused on your cell phone. Using a cell phone while driving uses all three types, which highly increases the chances of getting into an accident. \"People are as impaired when they drive and talk on the cell phone as they are when they are intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08%.\" (\"Distracted Driving Facts\")\\n\\nIf people are as distracted as a driver that is intoxicated while using a cell phone while driving is just as if not more dangerous on the road. Also, there are most likely more people on their cell phone while driving than people under the influence of alcohol on the road.\\n\\nNot only are there problems with endangering other and yourself, there are also economic problems. \"Economic losses from distracted driving could total $46 billion a year.\" (\"Background on: Distracted driving\").\\n\\n\"NHTSA released a study in May 2014 which focused on behavioral factors that contributed to 32,999 highway fatalities and 3.9 million injuries in the U.S. in 2010 the study found that those crashes cost $277 billion in economic losses and $594 billion in societal harm, for a total of $871 billion that year\"\\n\\n(\\'Background on: Distracting driving\"). Therefore, we are also losing billions of dollars a year due to distracting driving, Which could lead to are government increasing taxes to get that money back. Not only will it put our country in debt but maybe even people living here.\\n\\nFinally, the laws for driving and being on your cell phone should be a lot more strick, and enforced stronger. We cannot have innocent people getting injured or killed every year because people are being distracted by their cell phones. Also, we can\\'t let our country get in debt because of this either, no one wants taxes to be raised just to pay back all that money, instead let it be used for schools or other educational purposes.

Phone use while driving should be banned because it is a safety hazard for the driver and/or passengers involved and is comparable to driving under the influence.\\n\\nFirst, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in a vehicle because it is a safety hazard. Is trading your life for a text message really worth it? Studies have shown that many deaths and injuries on the road are caused by distracted drivers. Usually the distractions end up being simple texts and notifications that can wait. Better to respond late than never.\\n\\nDrivers should be banned from using cell phones while driving because it is comparable to drunk driving. Now that is said because both distracted and drunk drivers share the same trait. They both do not show enough mental focus to manage a vehicle. Both driving types have become an epidemic in today's era and some are even going as far as saying that distracted driving is even more dangerous. Drivers who text while operating the vehicle are 8 times more likely to crash than drunken drivers according to a Fox News 13 study.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phone usage while driving is proven extremely hazardous and selfish.

All I could feel was the car hood's mass stamping my body father and farther into the ground. My lungs felt pinched shut and air would neither enter nor escape them. My mind was buzzing.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nwhose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.         \",\n",

Texting and driving has cause many fatal accidents. As of July 1,2018, Georgia is now a hands-free state.\\n\\nBecause I have brought up the hands-free law, let us discuss it. Drivers are not to have any mobile devices in their hands. They're required to use: speakerphone, earpiece, bluetooth, or an electronic watch. While driving a driver can not send messages, read social media, or make videos. These reasons cause accidents. If a driver is: reporting a crash, medical emergency, fire, suspicious activity, or hazardous road conditions is the driver allowed to use their mobile devices.\\n\\nThe vast majority of car crashes in Georgia have been in rear-end crashes, single-car crashes and crashes by drivers from 15 to 25 years-old. There are 15 states that have passed the hands-free law. In those fifteen states, they have saw a 16 percent decrease in fatalities.

This is dangerous do to the fact that people can get into car wrecks due to the fact they are worrying about their phone at that moment.\\n\\nPeople forget that the road is shared with other people and that it is shared with other people being on there phone. The National Safety Council have estimated 1.6 million car crashes due to phones and nearly 400,000 injured.

Along with this phone evolution cars have had a just as impressive evolution as phone. In 1885 Karl Benz invented the first car. A year later Gottlied invented the engines for the car. Now although both inventions are very impressive, important, and developed well over time shouldn't mean we use them at the same time.

Many accidents are happening daily, and people are losing their lives. This way many fatal accidents happened, and even small kids lose their lives. The Law has been made in Georgia that requires hands free driving, that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone. The Law is still not as helpful as expected because many people ignore law, many people's mind is still distracted, and many people still use their hands for navigation. The first reason is many people are still ignoring the Law because the charges are very low, if they get caught the insurance rates are nit going to hike much for them. Auto correct mishaps are hiking, and people are texting, even if it is not legal. It is more dangerous than drinking and driving. The Law must be strict and have a penalty that must be $1000 dollars or get arrested. Just in case of emergency, driver should pull over and talk on the side if the road. The second reason is many people have stressful jobs and they attend a conference call or any stressful situations in the family front while driving. This can distract their mind from driving and even the hands-free driving Law can't be helpful to prevent car wrecks. In this situation, the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving, only important conversations should be allowed. This law can save so many pedestrians too, who runs into a car wreck daily. One example is of an old lady in Atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didn't even stop after words two weeks ago, according to the news. The lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot. The third reason I have is people do not talk over the phone always, but people can use their phone for navigation, music and apps. So those things are also distracting. The law should be made by the government that they can tract the minimum usage while driving and even if they must set up the navigation, they can pull over and do it. So, they can pull over to the side to use the phone and should be made on the interstate and the street. In conclusion, the usage of the cell phone in the car can't be eliminated totally, because cellphones are for emergency use. By only communicating important things and concentrate on driving it can turn into a car wreck and pedestrians can get into an accident.\\n\\nWork cited www. m. driving-tests. org www. livescience. com                                                                         \",\n",

Using a cellphone while driving should not be allowed because it is the root cause of many accidents that we have today.\\n\\nTo start off, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating vehicles because it can cause car crashes. Most car crashes nowadays happen because of someone texting while driving. Teenagers and others cause crashes because of being distracted. According to \"edgarsnyder. com\", 1.6 million crashes are caused by texting while driving. No matter how bad one needs to answer a text, one shouldn\\'t text back. A solution would be to pull over so that accidents can be prevented.\\n\\nAdditionally, studies have shown that driving while talking or texting on a cellphone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a greater risk of crashing into others. An extreme example would be if a person is walking across a crosswalk at a light intersection. The driver is approaching the light when the light was first green when he look then he started texting,while doing that the light turned red,so the person walked along the crosswalk by the time the driver looked up it was too late to stop on brakes. This is a prime example of being distracted while driving. It\\'s sad but true while driving and texting it takes your attention off the road to see what\\'s in front of you. According to \"braunslaw. com\", it states that the most common reasons pedestrians get hit is because,driving while texting or intoxicated harms others.\\n\\nLastly, it is important to note that driving while using a cellphone is illegal in most countries. It is also unlawful to drive in Georgia while using a cellphone. Georgia has a law called the hand held law. This law enables the use of cellphones without it being in your hand. The fines are steep, however, many drivers still use cellphones while driving. There are plenty of consequences for driving while using a cellphone. One is points on your license which means if you get a certain amount of points your license they can be took. Secondly you will have to take classes called \"mandatory road safety class\"why do all this when you can just stay off your cellphones while driving.\\n\\nAlthough some may argue that you should use your cellphone while driving, people are taking a risk while using their cellphones. According to the law, one\\'s cellphones should be used for one reason only, to call 911. In this instance only, one can agree that cellphones, can be utilized.\\n\\nTo conclude, there is no question that using a cellphone while driving is a major distraction. Besides, being the law, everyone who drives should realize that being distracted while on the road puts everyone at risk!   ',\n",
       " 'Cell Phones have been a very big problem relating to car accidents for the past few years, especially when it comes to teens. Cellphones are so dangerous when it comes to driving, so dangerous that they are sometimes the cause of deaths. Cell Phones shouldn\\'t be used when driving or operating a vehicle. Cell Phones have especially been the cause of many teens deaths over the past years, this is why you always see so many signs on the freeway or even on billboards saying to not use your phone it is better to read a message later than to be dead or the cause of someone else\\'s death.\\n\\nCell Phones have caused so many deaths or even fatal car accidents over the past. In an article by teensafe. com it states that, \"In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents\\'\\'. This means that in 2015 there were a total of 9 people killed by distracted driving a day. Imagine you driving down the road not even knowing what the person next to you behind you may be doing, maybe their texting on their phone, answering a call, or even trying to set up their GPS, and then all of a sudden boom your into a major car accident that could be the death of you. Cellphones are very dangerous and will continue to be throughout the years and coming.\\n\\nSo many teens dream of having their own cars, some are lucky enough to actually be gifted it to them by their parents, the only scary part about it is that some teens don\\'t understand the responsibility behind driving a vehicle without their parents or having someone to make sure they are driving safely. In an article posted by teenssafe. com it states,\" Each day,?11 teens? die in crashes caused by texting and driving.\" That means 11 teens are dead each die due to a simple text sent or received while driving. Imagine if you had a teen child who drove their own vehicle, they could fall into being those 11 people who die a day, honestly anyone could fall into that category it\\'s not just only teens.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is life risking and very dangerous, especially when the person behind the wheel is irresponsible. Just imagine losing a loved one due to someone who couldn\\'t wait to send a text message till they go to their destination. In my opinion a cellphone or any form of technology should be out of anyone who is operating a vehicle hand. Maybe you wait to get home or wherever you must go, to send a message it\\'s always better safe than sorry. Not only are the people operating the vehicle the ones in danger but sometimes even the passengers or the person in the other cars can be harmed or sometimes even end up dead.\\n\\nIn conclusion cellphones should be banned from being used while driving. It causes harm and sometimes even death to the one operating the vehicle or the people around him. Me as a teen agree with phones being banned, no one should put their lives or the lives of others at risk just because they couldn\\'t wait to send a message. Others may say that people need their phones to contact people for work or children may have to contact their parents while at home, but people need to understand that earphones exist now that help you answer your phone that having it in your hand and of course texting can always wait, if its so important why not pull over instead or just a simple phone call. In the end parents should make sure their children are responsible while driving and adults should know better than to use their phone while driving.            ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time.\\n\\nBeing on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention.\\n\\nYou should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency.\\n\\nInstead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast.\\n\\nIn some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.         \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nThere is no doubt that with how advanced technology has become in the past few years or so people have really advanced the technological possibilities. People have now started to make some of the AI's (artificial intelligence) like Alexa and Google Home. There are even some cars that allow you to ask it questions in order to find out the weather or finding the fastest route to take to work. Along with all of these technological advancements comes the ability to hook the phone up to a car using bluetooth. Now, should drivers be able to use their phones in the car while driving.\\n\\nThere are some really good uses for using the bluetooth phone hookup. For one in Georgia people are not allowed to drive if they have their phone in their hand. This is where the bluetooth phone hookup comes in handy because you can do in the car phone calls to work or to somewhere else. This feature can come in really handy because if someone takes a day off of work and someone from their work calls them and starts to ask questions they can answer those questions right then and there. That way if someone was ever needed to give someone some advice in their place of work they could just click a button and give them the advice over the phone.\\n\\nThere is also another use for the phone hookup to the car feature and that is so that someone can get notified if they do happen to have a family emergency. This is so that if someone does happen to have a family emergency and they are in the car already all they have to do is drive over to where the family emergency actually is. This is so that you can get notified if something bad does happen to someone's family member they won't have to wait until they get home to find out what happened.\\n\\nOnce again being that when they do find out instead of having to leave the house again to go and see what happened because this person is actually out and about all they have to do is go to the place of the emergency. This may be one of the sadder ways that a phone can be used for while driving but it still is one of the more important things.\\n\\nThe next reason for why people should be able to use their phone while driving is what if someone has to call the police. Using the bluetooth phone hookup feature that most cars have nowadays someone can call up the police and say that they need assistance with something. For instance let's say that someone has a very strong feeling that they are being stalked on the way home from work or somewhere else so they can then call the police for their assistance. This can also be a real life saver because this can also be used if someone's water breaks on the way to the hospital that way someone can go ahead and let the hospital know what is happening so someone won't have to wait. So, in short, phones can be used to save someone's life.\\n\\nPhone's have been useful since the time of their invention. From the ability to be able to talk to people from a long distance away to making sure that people can keep in touch with their work life. Next, being able to keep in touch with the family making sure to be kept in the loop if something bad does happen. Lastly, being able to call the police and other emergency services to save lives. Phones are a necessity in day to day life which includes on the road.   \",\n",
       " \"It has been statistically documented that cellphone-related accidents are increasing at an alarming rate. The usage of phone apps, texting, GPS mapping for directions, and social media sites have caused new laws and penalties to be passed due to cellphone-related injuries and deaths. In my opinion, drivers cell phone usage should be limited while driving with the usage of features such as hands-free options which should be mandatory.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council, 2019 Texting-While-Driving Report; the average cellphone related deaths is roughly 1,600,000 accidents per year. The top two most common distractions of automobile drivers are: talking on a cell phone and sending text messages.\\n\\nNationally the state of Georgia ranks number four by Expert Market research (www. expertmarket. com) with an average of 132.7 Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones.\\n\\nHowever, the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving is severely under- reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (www. nhtsa. gov/distracted-driving). The issues of cellphone related problems with Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones continue to grow when you consider the victims who have either died or experienced severe injuries by vehicle operators who have struck bystanders due to a simple message or post.\\n\\nEven though the statistics cause concern advocates for public safety feel that cell phone use while driving can be lifesaving for onsite emergencies, roadside assistance, and even responding to Amber Alerts. Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring,\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel that in the future cell phones and automobiles including cargo trucks alone will have driver algorithm and functions that will help decrease problems with cell phone- related driver issues. I do not feel that it is necessary to completely eliminate operating a cell phone while driving in case of a emergency especially health related or to even report kidnapping & human-trafficking which is a huge problem for the state of Georgia and nationally. Drivers need to be more mindful and obey the laws or be penalized by the new laws meant to protect people.   \",\n",
       " \"Usage of Phones While Driving\\n\\nEach year thousands of people die in car crashes because of the use of cell phones while driving. The number of these deaths increase with every year. This is a major problem, especially for teenage drivers who are new to the road. Teenagers are not experienced enough and can also be easily distracted by their phones. While driving, if not paying full attention to the road, a teenager or anyone else could easily crash or get into a dangerous situation such as running through a red light because they were talking on the phone. Many states have started to see an increase in the number of people who text and drive and this directly contributes to the growing number of car accidents. Because of this, many states, including Georgia have taken action in an effort to reduce the growing number of wrecks due to cell phone usage. However, it seems that these set rules are not as strict as they should be and many states are quite lenient with the laws. Cell phone use needs to be more restricted while driving any type of automobile.\\n\\nThe first reason cell phones should not be used while driving and should be more restricted is because it is actually illegal in the United States. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 14 states have prohibited all drivers from using handheld devices while driving. Additionally, 46 states have banned texting and driving. State legislatures have seen the exponential growth in texting and driving along with the increase of automobile accidents. Therefore, the majority of the states have made the decision to pass laws that prohibit handheld devices such as cell phones. Many people who use their cell phones while driving have tried to state that they have no problem focusing on their driving while also using their technology. They have said that they have used cell phones multiple times while driving and have not caused one accident. However, researchers have proven that a person who uses their cell phone in any form while driving, is 2.8 times more likely to get into a wreck. Texting while driving is even more dangerous with it being 23.2 times more likely to get someone in an accident. Just because it does not happen to everyone one, does not mean that thousands of people have not lost their lives because of this problem.\\n\\nThousands of innocent adults, teens and children lose their lives everyday because of the actions and choices of those around them. When teens or children are in a car with an adult who is using their cell phone while they drive, that adult is putting those kids' lives at risk.\\n\\n48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a vehicle while the adult driver was texting. In addition to that, 1,600 kids in that age range lose their lives every year because of people using their phones while they drive. Cars are amazing innovations that can get anyone to where they need to be quickly and efficiently. However, put them in the hands of someone who is irresponsible and a safe car becomes a potential weapon.\\n\\nThis is why cell phone use needs to be more restricted. Using a cellphone while driving gives the driver inattention blindness and also a slower reaction time. These are symptoms of drunk driving as well. If one would not drive with their children in the car while they are intoxicated, one should not text and drive or use their cell phone at all. A quick text or peek at social media, is not worth an innocent life.\\n\\nOn a lighter note, another reason cell phone use should be restricted is because it will save money. Drivers who do not use their phones while they are driving have financial benefits even if they do not realize it. Imagine all the traffic tickets, accidents and increased insurance rates that every person who uses their cell phone while driving has to deal with. If cell phones are more restricted, people will save so much money. While it does depend on which insurance company a driver is signed with, it has been shown that if one is involved with car accidents due to cell phone use, their insurance rates rise potentially up to 82%. Getting pulled over and handed a ticket more than once, means that person is now considered a high risk driver. High risk drivers have increased insurance or in extreme cases no insurance at all. If the insurance bill increases to be too high and that person cannot afford to pay it off, then the insurance company will sometimes repossess the car.\\n\\nAny type of cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous and quite irresponsible.\\n\\nRestricting cell phones to a higher degree would have many benefits. While plugging in a phone to listen to music is acceptable as long as the phone is not touched afterwards, texting someone back when it is not urgent or checking Snapchat, is not worth taking an innocent life. It is also not worth the driver's life. Car accidents and wrecks will happen to everyone, everywhere regardless of cell phone use or not. There are many other things that can distract drivers. However, not all of those things can be restricted but cell phones can. The rule needs to be enforced more. Once that happens, while wrecks will still happen, it will greatly lower the risk of more people getting hurt because their cell phone controls them and their actions.         \",\n",
       " \"Thousands of accidents happen in one year. Most of the causes of the accidents come from being cellphone which make you distracted. That one text you send can change your whole life in one second. That one phone call or that one text message is not worth your life. Drivers should be cautious when they are on the road, the road is very dangerous. The only reason that you should be on your phone is to look at GPS, anything that is not an emergency should not be important. Therefore, that mean the phone is not no where near more important than your life.\\n\\nCell phones can be a big distraction in your driving skills. The minute you look down at your phone is the minute your life can be taken away. You should have an hoaster in your car for your phone so that it won't in your hands. The phone should never be in your hands while you are driving the car. The road is too dangerous to not be focus on the road. You should an 100% focus on the road at all time. The only time that you should be on your phone is for the GPS or if it is very important. Your life is way more important than being on the phone, scrolling on social media, or sending a text. Why do you think in Georgia the cops are enforcing that you must have a phone hoaster to use your phone.

The people in this society are so addicted to their cellphones, it can be super dangerous to be using them while driving. The more time people use their cellphones while driving, the less aware they will be of their surroundings on the roads, which can typically lead to more accidents. Drivers should always stay focused on the road and nothing but the road. Here are some reasons why.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons why you should not use a cell phone while driving is to be able to focus more on where you are going and your surroundings. The use of a cell phone can get you distracted, which could lead to you getting lost or it could lead to a fatal car accident. It is very dangerous to be distracted while you are driving. The quickest few seconds you take just to look at your phone can be risking the lives of others and yourself. To prevent that from happening, you should keep your phone on silent so it would not be a distraction to you.\\n\\nAnother reason why you should not be on your phone while driving is because of the safety of others. When you are driving with other people in the car, you should always consider their safety, as well as yours. Once you start distracting yourself from the road, you are putting the other passengers lives in danger. Not only should you consider the safety of your passengers, but you should also consider the safety of the people on the same road as you. You have to be cautious of the pedestrians and the other drivers on the road.\\n\\nMost of the states are making it illegal to text and drive. States are making this an illegal law because of the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. Making texting and driving illegal will help decrease the number of deaths from this cause. Getting caught texting and driving can result in getting fined.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons why you should never text and drive. It is the most dangerous thing to do while driving. Even though it is very dangerous to be on your phone while driving, there are many alternatives. Instead of driving, you can pull over to the side of the road and respond to your message. Another solution is to give your phone to the passenger in the passenger's seat so they can respond to any messages. The most safest solution is to turn it off and put it in the middle console of your car, that way, you wouldn't be tempted to even look at it. That is why I believe people should not text and drive.   \",\n",

Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the us happen because of people being or checking their phones.\\n\\nAlthough it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less.

Drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle.\\n\\nDrivers are risking their lives when they decide to utilize their cell phones while driving.

When a driver is not being continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they\\'re putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.\\n\\nAlthough, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers.

       " \"Cell Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn today's society, the world depends on technology for nearly everything. It's used to communicate, do research, play games and even to give us directions when we are driving and lost. Everywhere you look you are likely to see technology in use, with one of the most popular devices being cellphones. This is easy to explain, as stated above, they are used for communication, access to internet, games and more. However, there are some instances when cell phones are a threat to our safety. Though cell phones are useful in some capacity, in most scenarios people should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nTo begin, one of the main issues with cell phones like many other technology devices, cell phones are a distraction when you need to focus on the environment around you. While driving, the most important rule is to be completely attentive to your environment. Others may argue that people are able to multitask and can still focus on the road while using a phone.\\n\\nThough this may have some truth, the problem comes when the cell phone distracts your attention from something that has happened on the road and/ or affects your reaction time. For example, image you are driving while texting a friend and you look up and notice a car swerving into your lane. With only one hand on the will you try to move over to avoid the car, but without full control of the wheel you end up turning too far and crashing into the another car. Even if you were able to drop your phone and put both hands on the wheel, by that time the car has already crashed into you. In this situation, an accident could have been avoided if you had been paying attention and acted quickly before the car came to close. Driving is already dangerous enough as something could go wrong in a matter of seconds, using a cell phone at the same time would only make it even more difficult in most cases.\\n\\nIn addition, despite popular beliefs, most people don't do well when trying to multitask. For driving, this means that if you are on your phone you are paying attention to the phone and not the road, even if it is just for a few seconds. But what could happen in a few seconds, some may ask? For example, you are driving to a friend's house through a populated neighborhood. You see that the street is all clear and take this chance to text your friend and tell them that you are close. At that exact moment at child runs into the street chasing a ball they had been playing with. By the time you look up it is too late to stop and you end up hitting the child. This accident could have been avoided if you had been paying one-hundred percent attention to the road. Even in situations when the problem is not another driver or pedestrian, there are still many things you should be paying attention to on the road. For instance, image the same example as above except there is no child in the road. The street is clear and you pull out your phone to text. At that moment you notice a pothole and swerve to avoid it and end up running over the sidewalk and straight into a tree. Yet again, this accident could have been avoided if you had been focusing on the road.\\n\\nAlthough in most situations, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, there are two scenarios which when it may be need. The first situation is when the driver is lost and needs directions. In this situation, using the phone for directions is necessary, however this should be done in a certain way. When this is the situation the driver should use some type of hands free device to hold the phone so that they can keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The other scenario is in case of emergency. For example, you are driving on the highway and see a bad accident occur but you are unable to stop and do anything. In this situation it is appropriate to use your phone to call the police so that they can get there as soon as possible to help anyone who may have been injured in the accident. Outside of incidents such as these drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity.\\n\\nTo summarize, with the exception of being lost or in case of emergency, drivers should not be able to use cell phone while on the road as it not only puts themselves in danger, but those around them as well. In today's society, there have been countless accidents as a result of texting and driving. When you learn how to drive, the first thing you do is put on your seatbelt, why?\\n\\nBecause safety is the highest priority. If drivers are allowed to freely use their phones when on the road, that means that safety is no longer the highest priority and countless lives would be put at risk of injury and even death. If a text message, call, game or anything else is that important it will still be there for you to respond to after you have gotten to your destination safely.   \",\n",

       " \"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving are just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion, I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours, an average of 660,000 people is using electronic devices while driving.\\n\\nWhen you text and drive you to put not only your life at risk but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.\\n\\nTexting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing death. When you text and drive you are distracted and not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving are bad and also illegal.\\n\\nAdditionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also, you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving do not need to occur. Don't do anything else in your car, only watch the road and both of your hands on the wheel. People need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in too.

According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of danger or causing an accident people still text and drive because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Cell phones are good in emergency situations but not while you driving. Although people support using cell phones while driving. That is dangerous and they should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nHowever, because of their habits they can create dangerous and hazardous problem like a collision or an accident. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phone while driving they can harm innocent people. Instead of your eyes locking or glancing at your phone they should be lock on watching their speed and the road.\\n\\nTexting while driving is a big issue and we doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and putting the others people who on the road lives in dangerous. Leave the phone hands-free while you driving, a text is not worth your life that text still will be there whenever you reach your destination.   \",\n",

Even though we all know being on the phone and driving is extremely dangerous. People should not physically use their phones while they're driving.\\n\\nUsing your phone and driving doesn't only put the driver in danger, but the passengers as well. A life should be way more important than a text message or notification. A person could look away for a split second and a crash could happen right in that moment. When someone is on their phone and driving they're very much capable of drifting off. Just a minor slip up could turn into a major accident.\\n\\nIf an accident was to occur due to someone being on their phone while driving, that person is more than likely going to be the one responsible. Distracted driving has become more normal in today's society. Most people often use their phones while driving because they feel capable of doing so. That same reason could be a cause of a death due to an accident. It would be much easier to avoid accidents if everyone started off their phones while driving.\\n\\nTaking your eyes off of the road for two seconds increases your risk of crashing. People feel as if they're experienced drivers and that they know what they're doing. That's what's using their phones while driving comes into place. They might just be experienced but those around them may not be. Those around them just might crash because they were the one in their phone.\\n\\nBeing a distracted driver not only affects the victims but those who love them. They can prevent deaths by just putting their phones up while driving. A notification or text message can wait until the car isn't in motion. Being impatient can cause someone to lose their life because of an irresponsible driver. Phone shouldn't be used while driving.    \",\n",

       " \"Today's society highly revolves around internet use and it can get to a point where people are using it everywhere and anytime they want. Using it while driving can be extremely dangerous therefore i highly disagree that phones can be used while driving because not only are you putting yourself at risk but you are putting other people's life at risk as well. One error can lead to anyone's death and putting yourself at major risk. That's some reasons why i disagree that we should text and drive.\\n\\nPeople are putting a lot at risk by texting while driving because your not gonna be as focused on the road as if your texting on the phone. Doing that can highly put risk a lot of people's life due to the fact of your reaction time is minimized. Say your driving on the freeway 60 mph and your on the phone your gonna be 50% on the road and 50% on the phone. Doing that puts so much risk and could potentially end someone's life.\\n\\nDeath can be something that can happen if your texting and driving because not being focused can always lead to worst scenarios. There are model predicting that text messaging are involved in 6-16% of all car accidents in the US. With that being said there's a chance an accident happening and that's very dangerous. People just need to put there phones down and focus more on the road before it potentially ends bad for them.\\n\\nSome ways of preventing this would be to tell family, friends and organizations to which you belong about the importance of driving without distractions. Also Take information to your kids' schools and ask that it be shared with students and parents. Doing this will be so much awareness and can help so much when texting and driving and safe many lives. No one should text and drive and if you need to text or talk on the phone, pull over to a safe place. Set rules for yourself and help someone out !\\n\\nWith that being said there are ways of preventing an accident and helping out lives. I disagree with driving with phones because it can cause many life changes and that is very painful. Putting your phone to the side is safer than keeping it with you non stop. Therefore in my opinion there should be a law or ban of any types of phones in a car.               \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of people own and operate their phones while driving their vehicles which will always be a no go. That\\'s very dangerous and now it is illegal to do so, if you are caught texting and driving or even talking on the phone while you are driving you will get pulled over and maybe sent to jail.\\n\\nI feel like the only time you should talk on the phone and drive is if its an emergency with your kids, mom, husband, or dad. You probably shouldn\\'t then but i know i would because i would want to know what\\'s going on with either of them.\\n\\nTexting and driving causes many wrecks, and kills hundreds of people each year. And it\\'s all over a simple little text you could have read after you got to a stopping point or could have even waited until you got home. I risk my life every day just like any other person just by texting and driving and the text dont even be that important but to me it is. Over 50% of crashes are because of people who text and drive. When you are engaged in a conversation from calling or even texting your attention is divided causing you to hit something or someone and who\\'s to say you will make it out of that?\\n\\nThere are so many ways texting and driving can be permitted, even if you have to leave your phone at home just to run to walmart do it!! Because no phone is worth losing your life over i promise it\\'s more to that. A simple \"ok\" text could lead into you getting in a wreck being left in critical condition with doctors telling your family \"you might not make it\" do you want that to happen?

       " 'On the contrary car crashes due to cell phone use goes up each year. People lose their lives daily by trying to do something that may be so simple to them. Maybe trying to change a song, text someone back, take a picture, etc. People do not realize that anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Just like that loved one of yours could be dead or severely injured. You should never be on the phone by any means while driving.\\n\\nFor this reason, I think you should always be hands-free while driving no matter what.\\n\\nThink about \"Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 metres per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you.\"You being on your phone while driving you put your life potentially at risk and other drivers. Causing us to have accidents that could have been avoided but now is a serious problem because someone may be hurt. A text message or skipping a song is worth more than your life or someones else. Therefore will driving always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\\n\\nIn addition, being on the phone while driving causes a two-second distraction. Increasing the chances of you being in a car crash. For instance, \"mobile phone use while driving increases your risk of accident by up to 400 per cent, points out that, in 2016 alone, police in NSW charged 39,000 people for doing so (100 drivers a day are busted for it in NSW and VIC).\" Just put your phones down and focus on the road. You don\\'t want to be the person who may have killed someone loved one. You never know at the time if it may be more then one person was in the car at the time of the accident and someone may have gotten injured. Now you have to take responsibility in that situation when it all could have been avoided if you have chosen not to use your phone while driving.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, everyone knows right from wrong. Doing anything, in general, that may distract you even in less of a second is just something you shouldn\\'t do. Innocent people have been killed or severely injured due to these kinds of things. Now someone may have just taken their last breath of fresh air, someone may have taken their last steps and is now paralyzed. This has been something that has been a problem for a while and should have been put a stop to it.\\n\\nIn the end, we all make our own decisions but deep down we know which one is right. No one wants to live with that guilt in their mind for the rest of their life knowing they were the reason someone\\'s family or friend passed away. Don\\'t be the reason, be the person who does the right thing and making it safer on the road for people.\\n\\nWork Cited https://www. carsguide. com. au/car-advice/why-you-really-shouldnt-use-your-mobile-phone-while-driving-33062 2            ',\n",

But just looking down at your phone could end things for you and others.\\n\\nCould be someone walking, another car, a child, an animal, anything.

Cell phones should not be a priority while driving, you are trying to get from point A to point B. You should be able to wait till you are out of the car to answer a text or check social media.

Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nDriving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it\\'s raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it\\'s not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.\\n\\nAnother example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don\\'t know where they\\'re going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.\\n\\nTo keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not \"record or broadcast a video\" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.\\n\\nDriving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.       ',\n",
       " 'Texting and Driving is Dangerous\\n\\nMany people use cellphones on a daily basis while driving a car. This is a common practice for some teenagers and is a form of distracted driving known as \"Texting and Driving.\" In many states it is illegal to text and drive. There have been laws adopted in many states to prevent people from texting and driving while in a vehicle. Even though people do it, drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any compacity while operating a vehicle because it takes their eyes away from the road. The use of a cellphone while driving is very dangerous, careless, and cause crashes that hurt and kill people.\\n\\nAdditionally, when driving a car, the driver should be alert and paying attention to their surroundings. The driver should not be dialing, sending a text, or reading Facebook because it stops the driver\\'s concentration from the road. Texting while driving is the cause of more than 58% of crashes involving teen drivers. Life is more important than \"I\\'m close or an OMG\" text! It takes five seconds to send a text and five seconds to be the cause of a crash, that can hurt or endanger the lives of other people. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nFurthermore, in Georgia, laws have been made prohibiting the use of cellphones while driving a vehicle. It is illegal to hold a cellphone in your hand or on any part of your body and if violators get caught, you will have to pay a large fine. The law should be enough to stop people from driving and using their cellphones, but it\\'s not. On the news, in Cobb County, the police dresses up as utility workers at various intersections to catch violators using their phones and most of the time they catch a lot of drivers and give out traffic citations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, no one should be on their phone while driving because it is a risk to them and other drivers on the road. Cellphones are a wonderful invention and one of the greatest inventions made by man, but texting while driving is very dangerous and can cause death to other drivers. This can also result into being convicted of murder and life in prison.\\n\\nReferences 1.

       " \"The prompt is talking about if people are able or unable to use their cell phone while they are driving or when they are at a stop light or stop sign. I think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phone, the reason why is because most of the time car crashes happened when people are using their cell phone but, I think people are able to use their cell phone when they are at a stop light. When people are using their cell phones that what causes a car crash. The way people get in a car crash is when they driving and looking at the cell phone to text people back they look away for a good amount of second that a car can switch to their line and because the person on their cell phone they would see in till it is to late. people shouldn't use their cell phone because most death are because or the cell phone. But at a stop light I think people are able to look at their cell phone and use it because you are not moving or anything you are just in one spot, so you won't hit anything and you do got time to use their cell phone because the light takes forever to change to green. So to me I disagree that using your cell phone while driving should be a no go because that's how much of the people get a ticket or get into a car crash that sometimes they get hurt or they hurt others so that's why it think driving while using your phone should be banned. But I agree that if you are at a stop light you are able to use your for because you are in one places you are not moving at all and also the light takes time to change so you can go that why I agree that it is the only time to see who texted you and text back.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe use of cell phones while operating a vehicle should not be allowed. Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are.\\n\\nTo begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can't. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.\\n\\nIn fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.\\n\\nTo tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.\\n\\nAs a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.         \",\n",

The zebra conducted a national survey of young drivers to determine their perception of texting and driving. 36% of respondents aged 18-24 admitted to texting while driving. Using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should never be done.\\n\\nOne reason why you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you could put yourself at risk of injuring yourself or someone else. Say your driving and you hear your phone\\'s notifications going off you feel the urge to pick up your phone just to see what it is out of curiosity and you Know you shouldn\\'t pick up your phone because you are driving but you still pick it up anyway. That one moment you look up to see a person crossing the street and are lucky enough to press your foot on the brakes in time to stop in the intersection. Consider yourself lucky as you could\\'ve injured that person. Things like this can happen which is why you should be more careful when driving.\\n\\nSecond reason why you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you should consider who your riding with whether it be a friend or group of friends or maybe family members you wouldn\\'t want to risk their lives and yours only because you grabbed your phone to look at for a few seconds. You should think twice before reaching for that phone and think about what you do. If they say don\\'t use your phone listen to them and don\\'t think about it focus your eyes on the road. It is not worth all the trouble.\\n\\nFinally, the third reason you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle is it is probably illegal. Almost all the states including some without cellphone prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. When on the road be careful what you do and don\\'t think about grabbing your phone even if it\\'s just for a few seconds.\\n\\nOverall, you should never use your phone while operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous. Remember you could risk injuring yourself or someone else. Consider who your driving with and it is probably illegal depending on the situation.\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\n\"Texting and driving statistics 2019\", \"the zebra\", insurance zebra, 21 March 2019, https://www. google. com/amp/s/www. thezebra. com/texting-and-driving-statistics/amp/\\n\\n\"States laws restricting texting and cellphone use while driving, \"nolo\", McCurley, John, 21 March 2019, https://www. nolo. com/legal-encyclopedia/cell-phones-texting-driving-state-laws-29774. html                        ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nWhen we think of cell phones we think of a device that we can't live without. A cell phone is something so essential to our lives that when we use them we tune everything else out. We constantly stay on our cellphones to distract us from the problems that are happening in the real world. We use our phones everywhere we go but we never watch our surroundings. When driving it is important to know your surrounding but when you're distracted by messages and phone calls and social media it puts the passengers and your life at risk\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at four times greater risk of a crash. Despite a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hands-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary for emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nYes, people should enjoy their rights to talk, text, snap, and all the uses of their phones just not while they're in their car. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.     \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nImagine that you are driving and you get a text from someone and you feel that you just had to answer. Then you respond and when you look up your unable to stop in time and then everything goes black. This whole situation could have been avoided if being on your phone was not as important as your well being and others. Although it may be convenient to text while driving, it is increasingly becoming the reasons for car accidents today. Texting while driving in any situation while operating a vehicle should not be used.\\n\\nTexting while driving is causing you to not have at least one of your hands off of the wheel. Looking down at your phone will make you react to anything that may occur slower. Someone who is attentive is able to react to a possible accident occurring whilst the person texting and driving would not. This is known as defensive driving when one is able to defend yourself against dangers on the road. One who is using their device while driving lacks defensive driving.\\n\\nUsing your mobile device while operating a vehicle is said to be \"approximately 18% of all fatal crashes are caused by texting and driving\", according to drive-safely. net. Within the year of 2012 itself, 3,328 people were killed because of texting and driving; while around 420,000 were injured. Also, a poll taken in the United States showed that 40% of teen drivers had admitted that they text and drive. These numbers have went up five times as much as they were.\\n\\nMost people do not know this or choose to ignore it but texting while driving is illegal. Many states either have specific or various laws about texting while driving. If there was an accident to occur and and authorities find out it is due to texting and driving then you will end up facing a judge. For example, if you were texting and driving and you were to distracted on your phone to see a pedestrian then you could be charged murder.\\n\\nPeople tend to text and drive without realizing that it may cost their life or someone else\\'s. A text is never that important that could possibly change your life for the worse. It may be considered cool or easier to just be on your phone whenever you want, but it is the increasing reasoning for car accidents. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason and that should be a very serious law to abide by. Before you decide to pick up your phone while your driving just ask yourself: Is this really worth putting myself or others at risk?\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDriversEd. com. \"Defensive Driving Techniques.\" Defensive Driving - Defensive Driving Techniques - DriversEd. com, driversed. com/driving-information/defensive-driving/defensive-driving-techniques. aspx.\\n\\n\"Esurance Insurance Company.\" Esurance, www. esurance. com/info/car/texting-and-driving.\\n\\n\"15 Facts About Texting And Driving\" Drive, 10 Jan. 2016, www. drive-safely. net/15-facts-about-texting-and-driving/.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A lot of things in the 21st century have to do with using a cell phone, including driving. Although some people may agree with using a cell phone while driving, others may disagree. They all have their own reasons why, but I'm going to explain why drivers should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nThere are lots of benefits when using a cell phone while operating a vehicle, but the most important benefit of cell phones during driving is the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and the driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route or find his/her way back home if they are lost. Using FMs on cell phones can also provide information about weather and traffic.\\n\\nRegulating cell phone use is not a federal responsibility, even on federal roads. This is not an issue that Washington has the authority to address. There's no compelling reason for it. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that 3,092 traffic deaths last year involved distracted drivers. But using a cell phone is only one of many driver distractions. Eating and drinking while behind the wheel are two others, and they are far more dangerous than yapping on the phone. In fact, a 2009 NHTSA study found that 80% of all car wrecks are caused by drivers eating or drinking, not cellphone use, with coffee-guzzling the top offender.\\n\\nAccording to federal data, traffic deaths have fallen from 2.1 per 100 million vehicle miles in 1990, when virtually no one had a cellphone, to 1.1 in 2009, when almost everyone does. We have no problem with bans on texting while in the driver's seat. Texting forces a driver's eyes off the road and is clearly risky. But it must be done at the state level. That's how federalism works. States that don't see texting as a threat on their roads are free to keep it legal.\\n\\nBut banning cellphone use? Why aren't the Potomac nannies going after Starbucks sippers and Big Mac munchers instead? Why not prosecute women who put on their makeup while on the road and men who shave? Shouldn't combing while driving be outlawed as well? This is all coming, of course, from the same Washington that's commanding automakers to build more fuel-efficient cars, which is likely to result, as it has in the past, in more carnage as the cars have to be smaller and lighter to meet the standards. If federal meddlers really wanted to keep traffic fatalities down, they'd reverse their fuel-efficiency demands.\\n\\n..               \",\n",
       " 'People use their cell phones for just about everything. Citizens on the daily, use their phones for GPS, texting, calling, social media, etc.. There are pros and cons to using cell phones while driving, also depending how you use them. But if I had to choose in between the two, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle unless there\\'s an emergency, and here\\'s why.\\n\\nAccidents happen every day and it is very rare at times, that people make it out alive. People are dying almost every day from car accidents because of cell phones. About 30 percent of accidents involve talking, texting on cell phones. That should send a message to people saying, \" Hey, stop texting and driving\". When you decide to use your phone and drive, you\\'ve basically just decided to put not just you, but someone else\\'s life at risk.\\n\\nTake consideration in your passengers, pedestrians, and other people\\'s operating a vehicle life. It does not take long to pull over or park your car to take care of whatever was so important that u had to put other lives in danger and pull your cell phone out. You need to really think about what\\'s really important when your want to pull your phone out. And let\\'s not just skip over the fact that is illegal. Being pulled over or caught on your phone while driving can affect you, negatively.\\n\\nWith driving and using your phone being against the law, if you are caught, you will get an automatic fixed penalty notice, three penalty points, and a fine. And if your license gets suspended and you continue to drive, it\\'s an additional 6 months. So slow down and really ask yourself is this worth picking up the phone right away to text your boyfriend/girlfriend back. Is this really this time to call friends and make plans? I would say it\\'s a lot to think about but it\\'s not. Just do the right thing.\\n\\nImagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn\\'t deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That\\'s a decision for you to make. But I would tell you, \" No, we as drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle\".

       " 'Phones & Driving: By: PROPER_NAME\\n\\nDrivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle for these reasons. The first reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is to inform loved ones if the situation their in changes, they can do so if they have handsfree because if they do not have handsfree it is illegal especially in Georgia. The second reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is that it is nighttime, and they have trouble staying awake, so they call loved ones and have a conversation to help them stay awake, doing so with a handsfree. The third reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because drivers pay a lot of money to get handsfree. Not be allowed to use cell phones at all is like the government robbing them twice. Twice because once for the handsfree, and another for a ticket for using it. The fourth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because they might need to report a bad driver.\\n\\nThe fifth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones operating a vehicle is because they might listen to satellite radio on their phone instead of listening to FM radio. On their phone because it is better for their money to use it at home and outside of the car and when you are in the car instead of using the satellite radio source on the radio to connect their phone to Bluetooth and play satellite radio there. The sixth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because someone at your job may not know your on the road and try and call you and you need to answer it.\\n\\n[Last Name] 4                                                                              ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nPeople driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident. Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIf you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger. Looking away from the road for even just 2 seconds can be the difference between life and death because one moment the roads might be clear and the next you could be rolled over trapped in your car.\\n\\nWhen you are on your phone while driving, you are not only putting your life in danger but the lives of everyone around you on the road and possibly even pedestrians on the side of the roads. There are many deferent alternatives to being on your phone while driving, such as Bluetooth enabled devices that connect to the car so that you can still talk on the phone without using your hands. Another alternative is if you have a passenger, for them to read you the information and relay it back for you. That is just a few ways to avoid staying on your phone while driving   \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn my opinion, drivers shouldn\\'t have access to cell phones while driving on the road.\\n\\nThe reason is that we have too many accidents, Insurance Rates & it\\'s illegal. If you are texting and driving you are 23 times more to have a car crash. According to the stats, 49 percent of American Adults drivers admitted while driving. Over drinking and driving texting and driving has passed to number 1 on distractions for people while driving.\\n\\nAccording to The National Safety Council reported that in the past year people there were 1.6 million crashes due to texting and driving. Also as I stated in my intro paragraph \"if you are texting and driving you are 23 more times more likely to have a car crash. 1 out of 4 car crash deals with on the phone while driving. In 2013 3,154 people died in car accidents due to texting and driving. In 2016 263 Teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of texting and driving.\\n\\nAlso if you text and drive your Car Insurance Rate will go up. Because of people texting while driving Insurance rates have gone up 20 percent since 2014. More and More Insurance companies are starting to track cell phone use for drivers they insure. Car Insurance premiums are determined by many different factors including where you live, your age and your driving history. Why does texting and driving impacts everyone? Because so many people do it car insurance companies have been raising their rates.\\n\\nAccording to the law there is 46 States in the U.S. plus Washington D.C. , Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands has banned/Pementid drivers from texting while driving.\\n\\nThirty-Seven states in all have a cell phone ban. That means that any cell phone use by the driver while on the road is Prohibited. There are three states that have secondary enforcement which is Florida, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Which means officers need another reason to pull you over before they can issue a ticket for texting and driving.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, I think drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their cell phones while driving on the road. It is too dangerous for drivers to be on their phones while driving. It causes accidents boosts up your Insurance Rates and plus it is illegal in most parts of the U.S. In my opinion it should be banned in all states that no driver should be able to do any cell phone use while driving. I\\'ve stated my opinion so what\\'s yours?         ',\n",
       " 'In the United States one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and about 1500 people are injured by these irresponsible people. Most of the time its because they are texting while driving. Technology has drastically increased. They seem to use their devices more than anything, which cause them to not want to put their phone down because they are afraid they might miss something. I feel like no matter what happens people might think they know how to pay attention. You still shouldn\\'t do it because you never know what might happen one day.\\n\\nPeople feel like they have to reply to a text message immediately , which leads to vehicular accidents that may result in death. The age group that are involved in these accidents is 16 year olds and up to 30. This should take a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person if you text while drive, it can cause your life or someone else\\'s.\\n\\nHowever, in 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes due to distracted drivers. For this reason, it is very important that we find a way to break the habit of texting and driving. If we don\\'t stop this now the rate of accidents and deaths will quickly increase. Law enforcement have came out with a law when you can not have the phone in your hand , do this work? No, people still text and drive and end up injured or killed. Because of this we should put our phones down or turn them off if you can\\'t keep your hands off it. A text or post can wait if it means it will save your life and someone else\\'s.\\n\\nSome people might say \"i can multi-task\" or \"i know what im doing\". Those that\\'s saying these things are the main ones that in involved in accidents. No matter what you think you can do you should still always be safe. For example, say you are texting while driving and some one walks across the street and you look up to late then BOOM!, another accident. Always go the safe route and keep your phones put away to avoid these situations.\\n\\nHowever, I strongly agree that texting and driving is very dangerous and I have the responsibility to put my phone down and focus on the rode. Texting and driving is the most dangerous thing on the rode today due to all of the technology we have. LIfe is more important then texting someone back , ask yourself this will they cause their life just to text you back fast?   ',\n",
       " \"Should We or Should We Not Use Phones While Driving?\\n\\nI personally belive that we shouldn't be active on a phone while driving. Driving while being active on a phone has caused 1.6million crashes each year. On the other hand nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents in the united states is caused by the phone usage. I tell my older siblings to not be on the phone while driving or not to text, you never know what might happen because 9 times out of 10 your interested in whats on the phone more than the road that your suppose to be focusing on. I know someone who actually past away from a wreck and there eyes where on the road so its a greater chance of wrecking when your eyes aren't on the road.\\n\\nA lot of people don't belive in having to not use something they paid for at anytime until they experience a wreck or hurt someone els. Like why even risk losing your life because you wanted to be on the phone while driving. There are even ways to prevent crashing while talking on the phone like putting it on the bluetooth it's even been proven to be the best way to talk while driving.\\n\\nThe reason me myself and other people say bluetooth would be the best solution is because you won't have to fumble with the phone while talking and driving you would have it right in your ear. Bluetooths are wireless earphones which you don't have to have your phone in your hand. It could easily be a situation were your talking on the phone while it's in between your cheek and shoulder and it slip and you try to catch your phone and lose control driving that's why i prefer bluetooth.\\n\\nDriving while talking can be done in a way but texting while driving is another thing. Texting while driving is dangerous because your eyes won't be a hundred percent focused on the road. I do not agree with texting while driving it's totally different from talking while driving. You will have to be hands on and looking at the phone in order to text. Meaning you while have one hand on the steering wheel and be looking back in forth from phone to road.         \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nPeople shouldn't use their phones while driving because now people are getting killed by people driving while using their phones. Over the years drivers haven,t been paying attention to the road ever since social media have been created.\\n\\nSo now Gwinnett County made a law so that drives can't use their phone to prevent death rate from increasing in the county. With today's technology cars will now allow you to call people through the car's bluetooth settings. And if we need a gps we can also input on the cars gps. Even though you can do all of this stuff now you still need to watch where you're going and the speed limit so you don't risk other people's lives because of how fast your driving.\\n\\nEven today neighborhoods are have kids getting hit on the side of the road just because your not watch the road, but instead texting while your driving. I even watch people look at their phones even if nobody's around you can still injure you and the passengers in the vehicle. Done the street on my way to my uncle's house there's a sign with gifts all because someone was texting on their cell phones. And hit the car she was in and caused a wrecked leaving one dead and two injured all because that person was texting while he was driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Texting while Driving\\n\\nTexting while driving is so dangerous, that it replaced drinking and drinking to be more dangerous. Reasons why Texting while driving is dangerous can lead to death and permanent injuries to yourself and others, adults need to set an example and also its illegal . A big part of the problem is people are very confident that can safely text while driving, some even claim that it is easy to do the two at once. And here\\'s why i believe these reasons are dangerous.\\n\\nTexting and driving can lead to your death and loved ones. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. In the United States, 3,328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone, while an estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver according to distraction. gov. Aside from the statistics and number of deaths, think about if you want to be the one responsible for a close friend or family member death or injury because you didn\\'t want to the phone down.\\n\\nAnother reason is adults need to set an example for the youth. Why wouldn\\'t young drivers think it\\'s okay to text and drive? They\\'ve seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents. Did you know forty-eight percent of young drivers have seen their parents drive while talking on the phone. This is where adults can help educate on the dangers of distracted driving\\n\\n- by setting the example and taking the \"it can wait\" approach. There are also many different resources for parents to help educate their kids about distracted driving. From text-free-driving pledges to drive cams that monitor a driver\\'s activity. A lot of people think it isn\\'t that serious to enforce, but it is . Its very important to ensure the safety of our young.\\n\\nLast but not least, texting while driving is illegal. Any form of text messaging while driving is illegal, and is considered a petty misdemeanor statewide. While the fine for texting while driving may only be $150.00, it also carries one point on your driving record, which may result in higher insurance premiums or possibly even cancellation of your policy. Fines up to\\n\\n$500; or $1,000 if an accident results. Another question to ask yourself while reading this essay is, you would risk your privilege to drive to send a text when you can simply wait, or pull over, turn your vehicle off and then send your message. If one is not able to do this then being behind the wheel wouldn\\'t be for them.\\n\\nIn conclusion is texting and driving can result to death, adults need to lead by example, and its against the law. texting and driving is a serious matter, and shouldn\\'t be taken lightly. It\\'s up to society to make the right decision and abide by the rules. As i said before if one feels these rules are bendable or not that serious they shouldn\\'t be behind the wheel and consequences will come with your actions.         ',\n",
       " \"Using Cellphone While Driving\\n\\nTechnology has brought us together and it is still developing for even more. We have electricity that fuels the car, we have cellphones that control TV's, and we have a computer that does things humans have hard time doing. When technologies combine, they make our lives easier; likewise, using a cellphone while driving is okay.\\n\\nPeople may argue that using a cellphone while driving is dangerous but any technology, if used wrong, can be deadly to not only ourselves, but lives around us. Therefore, people should be able to use cellphone while driving, but in a manner that is reasonable. Using GPS (Global Positioning System), to guide your way or to listen to music is a good example of using cellphones safely.\\n\\nUsing a GPS system on your phone while driving helps us to get to our destination easier and lets us focus on the road better. If we did not have a GPS and we were to look for signs to go anywhere, we would be very much likely to get distracted or get tired quickly. Yes, it is true that we can replace our phone's GPS with a GPS device, but again, if the driver is not misusing cellphones, it is essentially getting the same job done. Also, because smartphones are easier to control and easier to interact quick than a GPS device, it will reduce the frustration of the driver.\\n\\nListening to music can help the driver focus better. It can also wake up a tired driver up by blasting some music. However, a GPS device cannot do that; with its monotone robotic voice, it would make the driver get even more bored. Another reason why a smartphone cannot be replaced by GPS device or why we should be able to use our cellphone is that, in the case of an emergency. Drivers can easily access a smartphone and call for help while if you had a GPS device, not so much.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that we all should be able to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Of course, not in a way that they will be completely distracted by it, but by limiting the applications that we can access. Again, anything can go wrong if used incorrectly, so I do not see the reason why we should ban a cellphone from using it as a tool to help us drive better. However, the punishment for misusing such a device should be punished heavily. It is truly sad to see how many people are getting distracted by a small device and killing lives after lives. Cellphone usage while operating a vehicle should be monitored, and managed, by the government or the police, with a strong action, however, banning of a usage of smartphones will cost just as same amount of lives as if it was not.          \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nCellphones are a big part of the modern world today. Everywhere you look there are people using their cellphone, but one place no one should never be using their phone in their vehicle. Driving while using a cellphone is very dangerous. If someone has received a text while driving they should ignore it until they get to their destination, or a accident could occur.\\n\\nWhen someone is driving their phone should either be in their console or in the driver side door, and it should be on silent. There should only be one exception to use a phone while driving, and that is if someone needs to use their GPS. Then it should be in a secure place where they can hear the directions and know where to go.\\n\\nTexting while driving can be very dangerous, it can cause accidents and they may be fatal. No text call should be so important that it cost someone their life. Phones are very good to have just not in the car.    ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nTo some being on the phone while driving is not a big deal at all, while to others it is. Yet while for those certain people who think cellphone use while driving is not a big deal the statistics would suggest otherwise. So far in the year 2018 it has been reported that over 58% of car accidents have been caused by or are linked to cellphone use.\\n\\nThis alone would suggest that even for those who do not look at cellphone use while driving as a big deal that it obviously is one. As a result of this the \"Hands Free\" law which has been around in some states for decades was recently added and enforced in many other states. Including Georgia in July of 2018. The \"Hands Free\" Law suggests that an driver who is caught driving with their phone in their hand will receive a ticket with a fine. However you are allowed to use exactly one finger to navigate whatever it is you need on your device, while this is an exception is it really much of a difference? its still time b being devoting to something other than driving.\\n\\nWhile it is unfortunate for those who are capable of multi-tasking and are able to drive safely while using their phone. Overall it is much more beneficial to everyone\\'s safety if phones are just removed from the equation all together. Although unfortunately there are still millions of people who constantly break the laws each day and will continue to jeopardize everyone\\'s safety for their own personal satisfaction by using their devices while driving. However I believe there are many more steps we could take to help decrease the cellphone use while driving. Some apps and even cellphones are working to prevent the usage while driving by adding improvements that can monitor when people have began to drive and will lock the phone automatically while some just will block usage unless you are a passenger, this program is very helpful and a great encouragement but that still doesn\\'t change the fact that the apps that people tend to use while driving aren\\'t doing anything of that sort.\\n\\nIn many situations people only understand the severity of things once they happen, there are two different people int he world. the \\'better safe than sorry\\' and the \\'oh nothing will never happen, i know what I\\'m doing\\' people, there are definitely not enough of the better safe then sorry people , as humans we think our problems are more important than others and that is definitely not what driving is about , driving is about watching your surroundings at all times and anything that distracts you from it is something you shouldn\\'t be doing\\n\\nIn conclusion cellphones and driving are just a bad combination that definitely has proven not to mix well. Yet sadly for some it is too large of a task to put the phone down and focus on the road. While police and some software developers are doing everything they can to limit the use of cellphones in the car, we will continue to see the problem for a while. However it has been reported that in Georgia since implementing the \"Hands Free\" law there has been a pretty significant decrease in accidents caused by cellphone usage. Noting that from January to June the percentage of accidents caused by cellphones was 67% but from July when the law was added up to now November accidents caused by cellphone use has dropped to just 39% in the state of Georgia.\\n\\nHopefully after reading this if you haven\\'t already realized how detrimental cellphones are to our safety and that they are just not worth the risk nor the fine you could receive if you are caught driving while on your phone. As safety will always be the most important especially when it comes to driving as a bad accident could easily mean life or death or a very serious injury which many may not be able to recover from. Phones are just not worth risking you and others lives.                                                 ',\n",

In my opinion I say that people should not use their cell phone while driving. People lose their lives everyday just because of a single text or phone call. Researchers have come to a conclusion that using your phone while driving is 6x dangerous than driving drunk. If you answer or check a text that could take about 5 seconds but if you are traveling 65 mph while doing that who knows what can happen in those seconds. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving .74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. The fact that those numbers do not equal out are problem and this is why I do not agree that people should be allowed to use their phone while driving.\\n\\nTexting while driving is a problem now more than it has ever been, as 69 percent of U.S. drivers between the ages of 18 and 64 admitted to using their cell phone while driving during the previous month. Texting increases a crash by 23 times, it's a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. 40 percent of teens state that they've been in the car with a car with someone who was diving when using their cell phone in a way that put them in some kind of danger. While the maximum amount of time a driver can safely can change their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds on average to send a text message. Besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself, there are other simple ways to monitor your teen's phone use while they're behind the wheel. Start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving. We need to take advantage of technology, utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your child's whereabouts and driving habits.\\n\\nIn my opinion I think people should turn their phones off while driving. In this generations words don't mean anything. Signs don't mean anything. There are signs everywhere that say don't text and drive but due to the research nobody is listening. Companies are trying to go around this rule by making a profit. What I mean by that is we say don't text and drive but here's an example apple air pods you simply tap your ear and say text so and so and in an instant your message has been sent to whoever. I don't think that's safe either in no way is texting and driving safe. Even if you try to make it easier in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe. If you take your eyes off the road for even a second, the most dreadful things could happen. To many people die for that one text back that could have waited until you stopped or could have waited until you got to a red light. Many teenagers don't know that you could ruin your in literally 5 seconds.\\n\\nThere is one case in which your life can be saved when texting and driving. There is a law called the hands free law. Texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket. In Georgia, the texting and driving ticket is the highest in the nation. If you get caught in Georgia that is a $150 ticket for violating the distracted driving law as well as one point on your driving record. The highest ticket you could be fined to is $1,000 in Iowa I think you're better off just following the hands free law. More money you get to keep in your pocket. Then to think about if you're texting and driving there's a possibility of you losing your life and a possibility of you killing someone else.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Texting and driving is very dangerous but tempting. Teenagers are the most tempted to text and drive. The technology today is controlling are minds. Why not use it to save our lives? There are way too many people making a simple mistake that will determine if they have another day to live. In the future we will find more ways to break this horrible habit that so many people are used to. Parents should teach their kids how to drive without distractions. Friends should teach each other that no matter what they need at the moment no boyfriend or girlfriend information is more valuable than their life. The message will wait remember your life wont. To save your life and other people lives follow the hands free law.                                                \",\n",

It can cause them to be paralyzed to where they would rather had die in the accident because you the driver decided to not care about the other person in the car. By you not being responsible you took everything away from them. They will never be active how they were before the accident ever again.\\n\\nTexting while driving has done a lot of damage, it's one of the most dangerous ways to die. Each year over 200,000 had been a car wreck, and that number is slowly inclining. Having teenagers on the road makes it even worse especially in the generation we live in today.

       " 'Cell phones has the ability to be real distraction and is an easily entertainment while being behind the wheel. In a daily basis people tend to multitask but there are times and place to do so. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with especially with a cellphones.

Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving. According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (\"On the road\"). Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving.

In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of death.\\n\\nTexting and driving is just dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is most common and dangerous thing you can do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (\"On the Road\"). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is. Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol. Steering control while distracted in 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration. In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that\\'s number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distraction driving resulted in approximately 2,600 death in 2002. The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities. Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving under the influence.\\n\\nTexting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the insurance institute for highway safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers. Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason. In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense. There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise.

       " \"Distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in the world today. One of the main distractions is something that most people have with them everywhere they go, it is known as the cell phone. Cell phone use while driving causes many wrecks and injuries every single year. In fact, the majority of crashes every year are caused by distracted driving, due to cell phone usage. This being said, people should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving unless they have a hands-free option.\\n\\nMany people believe that they are capable of multi-tasking. The main thing people think they can multi-task at is texting and driving. When you are behind the wheel you are always automatically expected to keep your full attention on the road. Failing to do so could result in something as minor as a ticket, or something as major as a wreck that could seriously injure or kill someone. Let's say that you're driving down a not so busy street in a neighborhood. You think that because the street is empty that you should be able to text and drive without any issues, so you pull your phone out to text your mom. You don't even have time to glance down and back up before you run into a solid brick mail box, causing the inflation of your airbags. When that airbag deploys, it causes fractures to your face, and blunt trauma to your cervical spine. Was it worth it?\\n\\nAccording to many websites, at least 1.6 million accidents per year are due to texting and driving. Out of these accidents, around 3,500 people are killed and at least 421,000 people are injured. Many states now have laws that require you to be parked in a safe place before using your phone and failing to do so will result in a ticket. In most states you are not allowed to even have your phone on your person while driving. It must be put in a seat or in the console of your car out of reach.\\n\\nThere are reasons upon reasons as to why you should not be allowed to use your phone and drive. Many people don't realize, especially young people, that phone usage while driving can cause your insurance to go up a lot. I'm sure you'd rather put your phone down, than to have to pay extra each month because you had to use your phone. Another thing people don't realize is that when you are on your phone and driving, your reaction time is worse than if you were to be driving under the influence of alcohol.\\n\\nTexting and driving should never be an option for anyone these days. We have so much hands-free technology, that you shouldn't even have to look at your phone while you are behind the wheel. No matter the situation or who the text is from, if you ever feel the need to pick up your phone, pull into a parking lot and make sure you're safe. Remember next time you put your car in drive and go to reach for your cell phone, how many lives, including your own, that you would be putting in danger.                                 \",\n",
       " \"[Phones & Driving]\\n\\nTechnology and driving are a very dangerous pair they have taken so many innocent lives because people's faces are glued to their phone. In 2016 263 teen's age's (16 to 19) were killed by distracted driving. The NHTSA estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel. That's a lot of lives at stake because people are careless and can't just pull their eyes away from their phone's just to drive down the street.\\n\\nIn 2018 about 4,637 people died in car accidents related to distracted driving, by using cellphones. The technology of today has evolved or progressed to where there are so many new gadgets and apps that were constantly looking down at our screens. We also are always taking picture or videos while trying to drive and if you aren't recording yourself then you're probably trying to pose for the camera. Even when u don't like to drive and text or do whatever on your phone there are always going to be friends or family that encourage or want u to do something on your phone while driving. Out of all the crashes in the world 26% of those crashes are caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nMy reason for writing this essay is to agree that talking or being on a device while driving is dangerous. Here I will list my reasons for it being dangerous. First off it puts yourself and other drivers in harm's way and possibly hurt badly or even killed. That's you should put your phone away when driving or do whatever you have to do on it before you get on the road. Secondly you should think about the consequences before you do it such as, if I do this will it harm me and my drivers, or people in the vehicle with me. Even if you are a cellphone addict you should think about others before you drive and text.\\n\\nSo for the conclusion of my essay I will end it by saying this driving and text is a very bad way to hurt yourself and others on the road so if you care put down the phone, and put your eyes on the road. The world would be a safer place without people texting and driving and not paying attention to the road and their surroundings. We ask that the people that are texting and driving to please stop, because they are killing or are putting peoples children on the road in danger. I along with a bunch of other people feel distracted driving has to stop now.                     \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nSo everybody knows the question should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving? Now depending on who you are this answer might be different. However, for me it's a no. Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving because the use of cell phone is distracting.\\n\\nDriving is a privilege and can be taking away so it's best to just put away distractions.\\n\\nNow you and I both know cellphones are distracting as I mentions in my first paragraph, but how are they distracting? Well they are distracting by sending e-mails, texts, or pictures. Driver think that if they get a text that they can just respond really fast. However, those three seconds you take to respond can be the cause of a huge accident. Drivers just need to be aware that text can wait because you do not want to put yourself and others in harm over a text.\\n\\nFinally let's get on to the facts. Statics show that about 1.6million crashes happen each year due to cellphone usage. They also show that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to car accidents and 9 of those deaths are due to distracted drivers. But car accidents can be costly in other like increased insurance and fixing cars hurt you financially or you can break a bone and be hurt physically and financially because you have to pay for medication. These can also lead to other very stressful situations.\\n\\nSo to conclude if you are driving do not use your cellphone. The text or e-mail can wait until you have reached your destination. If you do you can harm yourself and others. Overall using a cellphone while driving cannot only be deadly but costly.   \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe number one cause of death among teenagers is car accidents. We can only assume that a number of these accidents were caused by distracted drivers. A distraction can come from anything, the radio, food, passengers in the car, and especially, the topic of this essay, cell phones.\\n\\nThe epidemic of drivers dying by the distraction of cell phones has become a major problem in the US because more and more technical advancements are happening as time goes on. When people are distracted while driving, even though it isn\\'t intentional and they may not be thinking about it at the time, they are putting themselves and others\\' lives at risk. In the state of Georgia, it has become an official law that you can\\'t even have your cell phone in your hand while driving. It is called the \"Hands-free\" law. You have to either have it completely put away, or up on a hands free cell phone stand in your car. If you get caught with your phone in your hand while driving in Georgia, you will get a ticket.\\n\\nCurrently there is no national law banning the use of cell phones while driving in the US; however, 39 out of 50 states now have laws banning the use of cell phones while driving, and almost every year a new one gets added. The rates of deaths by texting while driving have decreased since. In 2017, over 3,000 lives had been claimed by distracted driving, almost 300 of those lives being teens. That number has decreased since then.\\n\\nIn order to stop this epidemic from growing or even continuing, a national law banning cell phone use while driving should be put into place. Every year, the US is getting closer to that goal.        ',\n",

People are killed everyday by using their phones while driving. Sometimes people end up killing others while texting and driving. Laws have been passed to prevent texting and driving but many people still do it. These careless people make it difficult for other drivers to feel safe on the road.\\n\\nYou are more likely to crash if you're texting and driving. You are looking at your phone which causes your eyes to be taken away from the road. By the time you look back on to the road you could be seconds away from causing an accident. This gives you very little time to react and usually results in death or injury. You can just as easily pull over to the side of the road and text whoever you are texting. Or you could silence your phone and wait until you get to your destination to text back.\\n\\nAccording to https://www. edgarsnyder. com 660,000 people text and drive everyday. 1.6 million people die from using their cell phones while operating a vehicle each year. Some people text and drive because they think they can multitask. Others do it because they like their phones or texting so much that they do it anywhere. Most people who use their phone while driving are teenagers or young adults. The average age range is from 18 to 34.\\n\\nCompared to adults the percentage of those who use their phones and drive go down by at least 48 percent. Older people most likely don't use their phone while driving because they grew up in a time where they did not have advanced social media or technology and did not feel the need to be on their phones throughout the day.\\n\\nAnother reason you should not use your phone while driving is that you could get pulled over and ticketed. It is not hard for a police officer to catch you texting and driving. Most of them could tell by just looking at you since most people look down at their phones or hold it in front of them. A first offence ticket for texting and driving costs around 50 dollars and one point on your license. A second offense costs 100 dollars and a third offense costs 150 dollars. The points on your license go up until the number reaches 15 points in a two year period according to https://www. ajc. com/blog/commuting/georgia-distracted-driving-law-how-win-court/5vKbMEv47Mdrz2mRTBkkpK/.

By keeping your phone out of sight and reach. 3. By turning off do not disturb. 4. By mounting your phone to something if you are using a navigation app. 5. By leaving your phone at home.

Therefore, I say there should be a law against people having their phone out while driving.\\n\\nTeenagers are most likely to get in a car accident because of phones. I think teens get in more accidents than adults because they have their whole life on their phones and forget they are driving. Also, when they have drama in their life they have to check their phones every other second to see what this and that person said about them. Then they want to be all over social media to show people they are driving. The next thing you know they hit another car and someone is hurt. Lastly, they feel like they must text their boyfriend or girlfriend back as fast as they rather than wait until they are no longer driving.\\n\\nTexting and driving are one of the most dangerous things in the whole world to me. I say that because people know that texting and driving is dangerous, and they still do it. Then when it happens they say it's not their fault and they know they were on their phone. When they see that they hurt somebody, they ack like they are scared and sorry but all they had to do is put down the phone and drive the right way. That is how most car accidents happen these days. It could all be prevented if the phones were put down.\\n\\nIt is clear to see why texting and driving is not smart. Just think, what if every time you put up your phone you save a family from getting hurt. What if it was your family getting hurt because somebody is on their phones. How would u feel?

The question is, should people be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nI believe people should not be able to use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nPeople get distracted very quickly when they are on the phone. Many accidents are caused because people try to read or respond to text messages while driving. Even when using a hands free device such as a Bluetooth, talking on the phone is still very distracting and causes the driver to pay less attention to other cars.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council (NSC), \"Everyday 9 people are killed and more than 1000 people were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers\" (National Safety Council, 2019). In the same article, the National Safety Council said that \"drivers looking out the windshield can miss seeing up to 50% of what\\'s around them when talking on a cell phone\" (National Safety Council,2019).\\n\\nThe NSC also reminds people in the article that your mind can only process one task at a time, so you cannot talk on the phone and read a book at the same time (National Safety Council, 2019).\\n\\nThis is why even if you are using a hands free device to talk on the phone, the conversation is still occupying your mind while you are supposed to be focused on driving.\\n\\nMost states have fines for being caught texting while driving. If you are texting while driving and kills someone, you could be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter. If found guilty of these charges, you could spend a lot of time in jail. I think this is a really good law because even though it doesn\\'t stop everyone from texting while driving, it does stop some people who know this is a law and they could go to jail for breaking it.\\n\\nIn conclusion people shouldn\\'t be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Many people have lost loved ones and their own lives because of driving while being on their cellphones. Driving while texting and killing someone will put you in prison for a very long time.

Smart phones have made it simple to stay connected at all times, but behind the wheel should not be one of those times. According to DMV.org texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens. When you decide to do anything on your phone while driving you are putting more value on what you are doing instead of the lives around you. The act of being on a phone while driving is not only illegal, but also poses a distraction and puts you and others in danger.\\n\\nAt least 9 people are killed every day because of a distracted driver (DMV.org). When you are using you phone well driving it incorporates all 3 types of driving distractions. One being visual: takes your eyes off the road. Sometimes you can look at more than one thing at a time, but the road and phone are not included. Trying to send a text while driving is like trying to read a book and walk. The next type of distraction is manual: taking your hands off the wheel. Typing calls for two hands most of the time and driving calls for two hand, so unfortunately we only have two to give and I promise driving is the better option. The last type of distraction is cognitive: takes your focus away from driving. Most people have taken their eyes off the road to look at a cow or something of that nature and realized something bad almost happened and that is just a split second. Now imagine doing this at 55mph taking your eyes off to read a text, and reading takes a bit more concentration than just looking at a cow.\\n\\nIn addition to texting and driving being a distraction it is also illegal. A large number of U.S. states have passed law corresponding to this danger. Penalties for breaking these laws include: fines, license suspension, raise in auto insurance, and prison time. Do you really what to have on your chest the thought of you killing a father, mother, son, daughter just because you could wait to send a text? If you think about it the penalties are given to people who actually commit crimes. Do you want to do in the same category as a rapist? All of this because you couldn't put your phone up to get from point A to point B.\\n\\nThese penalties are the same as ones you get for a DUI. Thus meaning when you text and drive you are just as dangerous as an intoxicated driver. Driving with a BAC of just 0.01% increases your chances of causing a car crash by 46%, according to a 2014 study. If you'd never drive drunk why would you ever text and drive. Also According to the NHTSA texting and driving is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. Texting and driving is just as bad as drinking 2 beers. If you see how bad drunk driving accidents are why would you want to put yourself and others in the same situation just for a text?\\n\\nIn a word being distracted while driving is among the top most dangerous things you can do on the road. This is a bad habit to have but habits can be broken. Working on it now can save you and others from a world of pain and suffering later. There is no point in paying fines and jail time or even possibly killing somebody or yourself for a text. So next time you think about picking up a phone think again and put it down.   \",\n",
       " \"Too many people during these present days stay on the phone while driving. People should not be able to use cellphones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes yearly happen according to The National Safety Council. More than 220 million people in the US have a wireless service and just about 80 percent use phones while driving. Did you know you can be charged with multiple charges and a fee of 150 dollars and you lose a point to your driving record.\\n\\nTo me phones should not be used on the roads unless it is for an emergency. I have personally had an experience when my mom was texting and driving which led us almost getting into a car accident. Results from using phones while driving can lead to death, PTSD, depression if you get into a car accident. Using a phone while driving increases the risk of their lives. Also the drivers are more distracted making it hard to focus on the road which is leading to crashing. When stopped at a red light people feel as if it is safe little do they know it is just as risky because a car can come smashing into you and you wouldn't see it. Also you can make people mad because the light could turn green and you could be holding up a line.\\n\\nFor people to use their phone less there was a bluetooth, a hands free thing and air play which all 3 limit the use of the phone where you can just talk. It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone. Instead of holding the phone to your ear you just speak, call whoever and you don't have to touch your phone. It is easier to just wait to text or use your phone than to rather take your life. For Iphone users apple company made a do not disturb to mute the notifications, which is when you won't receive any notifications until you turn that mode off. There is also a driving mode you can turn on to send a message to a person who texts or calls you saying that you are driving and they won't see their message until they stop driving and check it.\\n\\nPeople shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because of how many crashes there have been yearly and in the past. If you end up using your phone remember there are different modes like the hands free, bluetooth, or airplay. There are a lot of effects that could leave u dead, with PTSD, depression and many other things. You can use the do not disturb as stated, the driving message mode where it sends a message. The laws should be changed on how phones shouldn't be used and they should make it more serious.   \",\n",
       " \"Texting and driving puts innocent lives at risk every day, Higher risk than drunk drivers. However, some people feel that creating a law against phone usage is violating personal rights. Others feel that banning someone from using their cell phones is equivalent to telling someone that they can't adjust their radio or talk to someone else in their car. However, using a phone, whether talking or texting, while driving can be dangerous to your family or friends in the car including you and the people of your surroundings. All of the damage you could cause and all that has been caused in the past can and still could be avoided by simply pulling over. There are so many places to stop over and relax while you drink something and respond to the text where it is safe. If everyone turned their phone off before getting in the car, then there would be no worries about feeling the urge or need to pick up the phone and risk lifes. Research shows that while on the phone, crash risk quadruples.\\n\\nWell-enforced traffic laws have been a highly effective countermeasure for reducing risky driving behaviors and the associated crashes, deaths, and injuries. However, it is not clear that laws limiting drivers' cellphone use are having the same beneficial effects. The research on the effects of driver cellphone and texting bans found mixed results. Even though the law has passed people are still going to text and drive but it helped a little and scared a few younger people being a law.   \",\n",

But unfortunately people are choosing to use their cell phones at the wrong time, while they are driving which is very dangerous not only to themselves but others on the road as well. I personally don't think phones should be used while driving do you ?.\\n\\nCell phones are used in our daily life in this day and age, but sometimes it could be dangerous for us to use them like while driving. Using a cellphone while driving is dangerous not only for the driver but everyone out there on the road as well. When driving with a cell phone it is sometimes hard to focus on the road which is putting your life and others life at risk. Everyday people die in car accidents because they made the choice to use a cellphone while driving.\\n\\nAccording to research cell phones are the main cause of accidents, and studies show that using a cell phone while driving puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a car accident.\\n\\nThere are people that believe that having a cell phone while driving is ok, because they believe that sending a text message only takes your eyes off the road for a few seconds, but what they do not know is that in those few seconds something terrible could happen. When a cell phone is used you don't think about your surroundings and how it may affect others around you that's how it is when driving and using a cell phone. The number one cause of car accidents just so happen to be distracted driving. Also increases the number of deaths per year.\\n\\nIn conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving, sending a quick text message or checking your phone is not worth losing your life or someone else's. I believe that doing so would be inconsiderate of other drivers and also pedestrians as well. Also it is illegal in many states. There are other ways than a cell phone to communicate that are less dangerous for example a bluetooth earpiece. But don't use the phone for the safety of yourself and others.   \",\n",

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn today's society phones are heavily used and relied on. The use of phones while operating a vehicle can result in minor to major injuries or a fatal life taking crash. In the year 2017, there was a little more than 3,000 people that died due to the use of phones while driving. It is indicated that phones may be an effective way of communicating, using cell phones while occupying a car results in the attention of driver decreasing and road safety concerns increase. A large percentage of fatal crashes involved cell phones. This essay will be informing you of why you shouldn't use or have a phone in your hand while driving.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle can affect the passengers and other drivers surrounding them.\\n\\nWhen a driver gets distracted it slows down their reaction rate by 37% which is more than being drunk and driving or being high on cannabis and driving. According to the website, https://www. dailymail. co. uk/news/article-2652015/Texting-driving-slows-reaction-times-drink-drugs. html when your driving with a phone in your hand it becomes more of a priority to see what is happening in the world right now or to see what people are posting and who texted them. Technology has become the world's best friend but also the world's worst enemy, technology itself has many trials and errors that have caused worldwide outbreaks of hacking or leaked information.\\n\\nIn addition, the technology used in cars today is well advanced and continues to improve. In today's cars, technologies such as bluetooth help improve a person's ability to drive. Bluetooth is a setting that can decrease the use of phones while driving. Bluetooth is a hand's free setting which allows you to control the majority of your apps on your phone from your car. Furthermore, the advancement of Smart Technology on one of the most used devices, our phones, have also helped drivers become more safe. According to, https://www. frayneaccidentinjurylaw. com/blog/prevent-car-accidents-tech/ engineers have come up with auto- braking, rear cameras, etc. The use of this technology in a car is crucial because it gives you another sense you never knew you needed.\\n\\nUndoubtedly, others may say that phones do not distract them and that they can multi- task. Over a million crashes have happened in almost a year. According to https://www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Even if you believe that you are focused and you're not distracted, science could prove otherwise. It takes the brain at least 20 minutes to get back on track for you to be able to focus. You don't have 20 minutes while your driving to focus on the road, it only takes 1 minute to cause a crash, imagine what could happen in 20. No matter how focused you think you are your not. Every couple of minutes a car crash has happened do to a distracted driver texting on their phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving should not be allowed anywhere in the world, phones itself should not be allowed while operating any kind of vehicle. Although people break this law everyday they don't think about the risks of what can happen to them or others around them. Other drivers on the road notice of drivers on their phones whether they want to or not because of the dangers that are created.\\n\\nPaige 3            \",\n",
       " 'In this generation everyone has a phone. I got my first phone when I was in 8th grade and since then I\\'ve just been on it probably 24/7.\\n\\nWhen I got old enough my parents were really scared in letting me drive because they really thought I was going to text and drive. And the only fault that I could point to is this generation. There are 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. I promise you if you go outside right now you will see at least one out of every 2 cars texting and driving. Teenagers just think it\\'s cool until sadly they learn the hard way.\\n\\nTo start everything, I just would like to say that I do not agree with texting and driving. Teenagers driving and texting literally, leads to nothing good. With us being teenage drivers, we are automatically easily distracted. Now imagine how our bodies react when we hear that \"ding\" that we get a message from a boyfriend / girlfriend. Your body just reacts in a way I can\\'t describe and it\\'s like you HAVE to answer. Then with you answering you get distracted and that means you\\'re not paying attention to the road and/or your surroundings. And the rest isn\\'t anything pretty to talk about.\\n\\nWhat happens next isn\\'t anything pretty to talk about. Like I said in my first paragraph nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from texting and driving. I\\'ve personally witness several accidents on my way to work. Some are worse than others but still, regardless of how \"big or small\" the accident is, ITS still an accident. Then in that spilt second you think to yourself and ask if that text was really truly worth it. There\\'s a quote that I always remember when it comes to texting and driving, \" it can wait\" think about it , what would of happened if you did wait to text back? Maybe there would have been no accident, I guess no one will ever know because YOU chose to answer that text.\\n\\nMy final thought in this essay, is my personal experience. One day I was coming home from work and I was texting my girlfriend and I blinked and within that second I got into a car accident. I\\'ve never felt my heart beat that fast before, I was extremely scared in thinking if he was okay and if I was going to get my butt whooped. My other experience is my 3 friends who passed away last year. They were speeding along with some texting and sadly they all passed away. it was a very tragic year, leaning to live without them. And that\\'s why I got all 3 of them tattooed on me. A reminder that im not suppose to text and drive.\\n\\nThat will conclude my essay but like I said , I DO NOT support texting and driving. Even blasting music and driving. Some people just don\\'t understand that driving is not a game. Its something serious and with your actions you can ether kill someone or prevent from killing someone.      ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nEvery year many people around the world are dying because of cell phone use while driving. Instead of keeping their eyes on the road, people keep their eyes on the phone. This leads to crashes, death, and injuries. While cell phone use can be beneficial in times of emergency or while using G.P.S, cell phones should not be used while driving.\\n\\nFirst, using phones while driving can lead to crashing. You can either crash into a sign or into somebodies' car. This leads to paying somebody money to fix your car or paying for someone else's car because you hit them. Also your license can get suspended. This all happened because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road.\\n\\nNext, unfortunately people who get into crashes don't always make it. When you're on your phone while you're driving and you get into a crash not only can you die but you can kill somebody else. Basically, because your being irresponsible you can cause somebody to die. Is it really worth killing somebody because you want to use your cellular device while driving. This is another reason phones shouldn't be used while driving.\\n\\nFinally, phones shouldn't be used while driving because if you crash and you don't die you cause injuries for life for your victim or you. Although, people sometimes use phones for G.P.S some cars are built for that. Even phone calls. If you want call somebody hook your phone up to Bluetooth before driving. This is another reason why phones shouldn't be used while driving.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, phones should not be used while driving. This is because of crashes, injuries, and possibly death. This is just irresponsible behavior that's leading to problems for people. Especially when there are so many ways to prevent the situation. Do you believe phones should be used while driving?                       \",\n",
       " 'Texting While Driving While there are many causes of deaths in the United States, a huge epidemic that concerns officials more and more is the amount of deaths occurring because of texting while driving. Texting and driving can kill in split second just the amount of time it takes to send a \"quick\" text message. Texting and driving is known to the world as one of the most dangerous things to do while on the road. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but also much more dangerous to the people and cars surrounding that particular individual.\\n\\nAccording to many people texting and driving is similar if not identical to that of drunk driving. For example texting and driving physically and mentally impairs you to drive straight down a road, without causing a danger to people. As a whole population, we need to stop the use of texting and driving whether it\\'s putting laws in place or designing a program that shuts off the use of texting the moment you step foot in the car.\\n\\nThe effects of texting while driving also can cause extremely hazardous driving conditions that compromise the safety of the driver and their passengers along with other drivers sharing the roads and highways. Because texting requires at least one hand on the device and the driver\\'s eyes away from the road, the focus of the driver is not fully devoted to controlling the vehicle. This often leads to lane deviation that could possibly result in potentially dangerous situations.\\n\\nTexting while driving puts many driver\\'s lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn\\'t. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.   ',\n",
       " \"Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.\\n\\nIt can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.\\n\\nNo driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.\\n\\nWhen you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.\\n\\nTransporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?\\n\\nWhile driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident. People should definitely reconsider before pulling out their phones while on the road. Dr   \",\n",

She was texting and driving. \"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). Based on this information, a lot of people have crashed their cars and been hurt or lost their lives to cell phone use while driving. Using cell phones while driving puts the driver and others at risk, and there should be no cell phone use (texting or talking) while driving because it can cause wrecks and even death.\\n\\nFirst, texting while driving is dangerous because it distracts the person driving which can cause an accident. When a person is using a cellphone while driving, the focus is on the text message and not on the road. Drivers need to be focused on just driving.

Cellphones can be like the devil.\\n\\nThe person is constantly tempted to use the cellphone at the wrong time and can become attached to it, which causes a lot of danger.\\n\\nTalking on the cell phone while driving is also dangerous because it distracts the driver, too. Whether it is bluetooth or holding the phone in your hand, this distraction causes car accidents which can cause death of the driver and others. According to the TeenSafe article, \"it takes only 3 seconds after a driver\\'s attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur\" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). That being said, no matter how careful one thinks they are being, one moment of being distracted can change a person\\'s life. When driving distracted by your cell phone, you can get into arguments with someone on the phone or can get horrible news that can cause you to lose focus on the road. This loss of focus can easily cause terrible injuries or even deaths. A lot of people have lost their lives because of their decision to talk or text on phones while driving.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, one should not drive and use their cell phone due to how dangerous it is. Driving distracted by a cell phone can cause car accidents with terrible injuries and even death.\\n\\nDistracted driving is dangerous to everyone, especially teens. According to an article on distracted driving, \"driver distraction is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes\" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018).

Their prevalence in today\\'s society is undeniable and has become one of the world\\'s most widespread tools. Their knack-like size employs their use at almost all times, allowing their beholder to multitask while using the device. This one small trait is the very essence of people\\'s disagreement with them. Many people stand against using cellphones and driving as this creates a problem for all drivers near and far. Cellphones should not be used while driving if you wish to be able to use it again.\\n\\nThe age of cellphones started, what seems like, yesterday and they had already grabbed the public\\'s eye. They allowed people to stay in touch even when the ones they wish to touch aren\\'t near by. This very reason is what created the epidemic and addiction to cellphone, connection. The connection across all boundaries is what\\'s gotten so many people glued to their cellphones. People nowadays can\\'t go 10 minutes without checking their phones. Almost everywhere you go, phones-phones-phones, their everywhere, in people\\'s hands, to people\\'s ears, in their pockets, their unavoidable. It\\'s even gone so far that many professionals have begun questioning if cellphone addiction is real.\\n\\nAnother major part of the problem is teenagers. As teenagers began to transition into the real world, some the first things they get are cellphones and their driver\\'s license. The phone almost always becomes an attachment. Along with the freedom to drive, this creates problematic gaps in society. Many teens are not the most focused individuals. They are often guided by impulse rather than intellect, and the simple beep of a text message is just the right impulse. A simple \"L.O.L.\" is all it takes to ruin their young lives. A few short words could potentially take the premature life of someone all because there hasn\\'t been any real steps taken to not allow this.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cellphones\\' grasps on the world is one that is hard to deny or shake.

For an example they can create dangerous, and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident .For this reason cellphones should not be used while driving.\\n\\nOne reason why using phones and driving because when bad accidents takes instance people or teens lives.\\n\\nthey are also ruining people life like making people can't walk again, forget how to do things like walk, and, eat.

Teens are so anxious to see calls or sent a text.\\n\\nTherefore, they should ban the cellphones completely while driving for the safety of everyone. When teens try to do two things at once. Multitask caused its them to have an accident quicker than a regular accident. Whatever the emergency, always wait until they stop or get to their destination.\\n\\nMy answer for teens is tempted to text and drive therefore they should not use cellphones while driving. Or have a phone in their surroundings. Banning cellphones while driving is for the safety of everyone.

I wondered if anyone has ever been told that talking or texting on a cell phone while driving could be your last call or text to anyone. Cell phones are our way to communicate. Without cell phones we don\\'t feel important. Cell phones and driving allows people to show off to their friends while driving.\\n\\nIf a cell phone can easily distract a person while driving than why are they in such big demand?\\n\\nCell phones and driving just don\\'t go hand and hand. If you turn on the television there is somebody talking about the best cell phone company in America. Telephone companies should have some responsibility when it comes down to texting and driving. The telephone companies have commercials that make a person feel like they have to have the latest phone, with the latest techniques, and the best 5G plan. If people would just sit back and look at how my grandma said she wrote and visited family members growing up in the country. Do you know how far a country mile is from my house?

If I wanted to go to my grandma\\'s house in Albany, Georgia I would be walking for at least two days or longer to get where I am going.\\n\\nIf cell phones are so great why anyone hasn\\'t came up with a device to turn the cell phone off automatically when driving. Now that would be technology in the making! If telephone companies and car manufactures could come up with a smart car that would be something to drive. Just imagine riding down the road and you have to call your friend to let him know you just saw his girl riding wither mom in the car right next to him. All of a certain the cell phone goes completely dead when you try to text or make a phone call. There is no sound and no light on your cell phone. Technology would be great if that would happen while someone is driving and texting or talking on the cell phone, the phone goes completely dead.\\n\\n2020 has proven to be one of those years we\\'ll never forget. The texting and cell phone law went into affect in2019 and I still see people driving and talking. The law is supposed to punish those people holding a hand device like a phone in their hands while driving.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny, the same people who are enforcing the law the police are the one\\'s driving and holding a held hand device in their hands while on duty. Well, I see the police are the ones breaking the law by holding a hand held device while driving. . So, who is supposed to enforce the law that we cannot have any mobile device in our hands while driving if the policies breaking the law as well? I guess that is left up to anyone who wants to follow the law. People are dying each and every day from texting and driving. It\\'s simple, just drive and talk later. I know people are going to say, \"I\\'m letting my friend know I am on the way.\" Didn\\'t you just call your friend to let them know you are on the way before you left the house? I feel that laws are made for a reason and they should not be broken by anyone. If no one is following the law than why do we have a law?\\n\\nIt would be so simple to just put the phone down and drive. Simple to just put the hand held devices down and drive in order to save lives. JUST PUT IT DOWN!       ',\n",
       " \"SHOULD PEOPLE DRIVE WITH THEIR CELLPHONE OR NOT?\\n\\nWe all love our phones now a days and basically ever since they were invented. Everyone has one or wants one or the newest latest one .Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones. With all the new technology and apps like facetime snapchat3 games music social media there's almost no way anyone could ever put their phones down. But according to statistics in 2013 about 3,154 people died in accidents 424,000 were injured. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.\\n\\nSo the question stands do we need to drive while on your cellphone? With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever. There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road.\\n\\nI do understand that you don't need to be looking down when driving and I do understand that phones are distracting. So you picking up a cellphone and calling someone can be distracting. Also like I said in another essay I did there is a responsibility factor to firstly own a car and secondly to even own a phone. It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve.\\n\\nSo really my answer is that it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly. Cause if you drive irresponsibly you should have your phone.        \",\n",
       " 'Texting and Driving\\n\\nCellphone is the most used technology in everyone\\'s everyday life wherever they go they have to bring their cellphones. Phones was a great invention that it helps people communicate anywhere and call anyone anywhere which is a good technology that can help people in everyday life. But Phones are the reason a lot of teens get into car accidents and can cause people\\'s lives.\\n\\nTexting and driving is one of the causes of car crashes this recent years, where the driver gets distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. One of the articles I\\'ve looked up stated that \"Studies show that approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their cell phones while driving every day. While this number includes people who are texting, it also includes people who are checking their email, making, receiving or checking phone calls and using mobile apps\" (\"Texting While Driving\"). This shows that a lot of people who are driving text and can endanger their lives and other peoples. As most people think that a lot of car accidents are caused by drunk people or people speeding the article \"The Real Reason You Shouldn\\'t Text While Driving\" stated that\\n\\n\"The most frequent driver mistake is \"recognition error,\" which encompasses \"driver\\'s inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance.\" In other words, most crashes are not caused by flagrantly intoxicated people, nor that aggressive driver who will do whatever it takes to get to their destination one minute earlier. Most crashes are caused by people like you and me who think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time.\" this shows that texting and driving is out of control and is dangerous for everyone who drive and text even though people know how dangerous it is, they still do it thats why states decided to ban texting and driving to stop people from texting while driving and stopping them from doing it.\\n\\nIn conclusion that people should take the law about texting while driving to stop the car accidents so they are less deaths and injuries due to texting while driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHolzwarth, Aline. \"The Real Reason You Shouldn\\'t Text While Driving.\" Behavioral Scientist, 4 Apr. 2018, behavioralscientist. org/the-real-reason-you-shouldnt-text-while-driving/.\\n\\n\"Texting While Driving.\" Hg. org, 15 Aug. 2019, www. hg. org/legal-articles/texting-while-driving -40319.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nMany people have the bad habit of using their cell phones while they\\'re driving every time they step into a car to drive somewhere. Both teens and adults have this habit and most drivers are aware that it is not a good habit to have. They could be texting people, calling people, getting on social media, etc. However, using a cell phone while driving is a huge distraction to the driver which is why it is such a bad habit to have. There are plenty of reasons as to why people should not use their phone while they\\'re driving and why it\\'s so dangerous to do so. If people are on their phone while they\\'re driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn\\'t do it.\\n\\nSince some people go on their phone while they\\'re driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident. If a person causes a car accident because of being on their phone, it can cause harm and even death to the driver, the passengers in the driver\\'s car, other people driving on the road, and even pedestrians. There are many handfree ways to use a cell phone while driving instead of having the phone in the hand of the driver. According to a website called driving-tests. org, it states, \"Hands-free technology is easy to use and widely available.\" An example of a hands-free technology that people can easily use would be a phone holder. With phone holders, people can place their phone in the phone holder on the dashboard so they can answer phone calls, use their GPS, etc. If the people with the bad habit of using their phones while driving get a phone holder, it would decrease the chances of getting into a car accident which will benefit everyone.\\n\\nBeing on the phone while driving not only is very dangerous and unsafe, it is illegal in most states to have a mobile device in the hands on a driver. Having a mobile device in the hands of a driver at any age is illegal in 10 states while having a mobile device in the hands of a novice driver is illegal in 32 states. Since it is illegal in most states, the consequences could be getting a ticket, having to pay a fine, or possibly getting some jail time. There is a website called araglegal. com, and on the website it says, \"Texting and driving makes a crash up to 23 times more likely.\" That is the reason it is illegal to even have a phone in the hand of a driver in some states because it results in bad consequences. To avoid bad consequences from happening, drivers can be smart to not even touch their phone while they\\'re driving, they could easily pull over to use their phone instead of using it while driving, etc.\\n\\nMany adults use their cellular device while they\\'re driving and sometimes, they even do it with their kids in the car. Doing that sets a bad example and gives a horrible influence on kids.\\n\\nWhen kids grow up and learn how to drive, they might use their phone while they\\'re driving because they\\'re going to think that it\\'s okay since their parents did the same exact thing.\\n\\nAccording to \"4 Reasons Why You Shouldn\\'t Text and Drive,\" it states, \"Why wouldn\\'t young drivers think it\\'s okay to text and drive? They\\'ve seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents.\" That quote from the website explains the mindset of a young driver perfectly; Having this mindset as a young driver is not good to have because it can cause multiple consequences for them. So if adults don\\'t use their phone while they\\'re driving, especially when their kids are in the car, young drivers will make the smart decision and not be on their device while driving.\\n\\nAlmost everyone knows that it\\'s dangerous to be on the phone while they\\'re driving but people still do it regardless. It would make the world so much easier if people stayed off their phones while driving because there wouldn\\'t be as many car accidents happening. Every driver needs to think about what would happen if they caused a car accident just because they were on their phone and driving at the same time. If someone caused a car accident because they were paying attention to their phone and not the road, and someone died, the person that caused the accident would feel so guilty. In conclusion, every driver needs to know the dangers of being on their phone while driving and why they shouldn\\'t do it so there can be less car accidents. If people are on their phone while they\\'re driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn\\'t do it.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn America today, drivers make mistakes, because they choose to operate their cell phones while driving. These mistakes range from drivers running through traffic lights or stop signs, to them actually colliding with pedestrians or other vehicles. People should not operate their cell phones while driving, because doing so is distracting, and can lead to unfortunate occurrences. When people operate their phones while driving, they are at risk of: insurance rates increase, being involved in an automobile accident, and being punished for negligent driving.\\n\\nOne reason people should not use cell phones while driving is because this can lead to insurance rate increases. Receiving citations can have an effect on insurance rate. For example, when a driver runs through a traffic light or stop sign and receives a citation by law enforcement, this information is generally reported to the driver\\'s insurance company. This possibly effect males differently than females. According to Isabel Prontes, \"Young men under the age of twenty-five generally pay higher auto insurance rates than young women\" (https://pocketsense. com>. Likewise, a driver\\'s insurance rate will very likely increase when they have an accident. If the driver is at fault of the accident, then they have to pay for damages done to the number of vehicles that was involved. Since Georgia has passed the law banning cell phone operation while driving; frequently, there are victims who continue to break this law, and eventually get caught. Receiving citations (tickets) causes an increase in drivers\\' automobile insurance rates.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are many incidents that can occur when drivers operate their cell phones while driving. If an individual is walking/ jogging, and a driver ends up hitting the pedestrian with the vehicle, this mishap occurred due to negligent driving. Moreover, some drivers run into other vehicles because they are operating their phones while behind the wheel, instead of being attentive to their driving. In addition, some people actually are on their phone, not realizing that they are pulling out in front of another vehicle, causing an accident as a result. Law enforcement suggests that drivers pull over before tampering with their phone or those drivers should wait until they reach their destination before engaging in phone use. Some accidents (due to cell phone use while driving) are even fatal.\\n\\nFinally, there are punishments that should be mandated for negligent driving due to cellphone operation while driving. One punishment could be major fines increase for all violators. In addition, negligent drivers should have to face jail time for this offense, particularly when the violator is found guilty of vehicular homicide. Undeniably, no amount of money can replace a life. However, drivers should be held accountable when they do not drive responsibly.\\n\\nThis essay has informed you on why it is not safe to be on phones and drive. Honestly, I do not agree with phone operation while driving, because, of the amount of fatalities that has happened, and also now in Georgia, cell phone use while driving is illegal. Cell phone operation while driving is still a major problem in the United States, subjecting citizens to the risks of: insurance rate increases being involved in an automobile, and being punished for negligent driving. Constantly, emergency personnel are racing up and down the highway, responding to accidents caused by cell phone operation while driving. People are trying to figure out how to prevent victims from operating their phones while driving by putting hands free phone devices and navigation systems in vehicles. Yet adults and children are still dying, because of phone use while driving. Maybe one day a philosopher will come up with a great invention that will prevent the injuries and deaths of more victims.                            ',\n",
       " 'Why phones should be banned\\n\\nIn a technologically advanced world like the one we currently live in it is easy for us to get caught up in our cell phones. Text, email, and social media link together all of your friends and family in one handheld device. With all these things we can do at the touch of a button it can be hard to put the phone down, especially while driving. What most drivers don\\'t know is that cell phones contribute to a high percentage of deaths and car accidents in teen and adult drivers.\\n\\nFirst, based on a survey conducted by the cdc \"Each day in the united states approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.\" This is an amazing statistic, out of the millions of people living in our country, thousands are getting killed and injured by simply looking at a text. Such a little task and it cost them their life.\\n\\nNext, in a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the average driver is distracted by a text for 5 seconds, at 55 miles per hour you can travel the length of a football field. Imagine the amount of stuff that could happen in the length of a football field. Deer, pedestrians, sharp turns, you name it, and if you are distracted by a cell phone you could end up hurt, or worse dead.\\n\\nSo is that text message really that important? Can\\'t it wait until the next stop? If you feel the need to check your phone i will tell you that waiting is the better option. If you check it right away you could end up as just another statistic and victim of distracted driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n-\"Distracted Driving | Motor Vehicle Safety | CDC Injury Center.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html.\\n\\n-Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov. \"U Drive.

As much as technology is a great essential to everyday life it is a huge threat to our lives especially while driving. People will always say \"It\\'s fine I won\\'t crash!\" Then boom one reply to a text that could\\'ve been sent when you have reached somewhere safe has taken your life. I want to speak on the importance of not texting while driving or just being on your phone at all, because it can save the lives of many.\\n\\nI believe that people should not be able to operate a phone at all while driving a vehicle, because not only are you putting your life in danger, you\\'re putting someone else\\'s life in danger as well. \"Reported by the National Safety Council that cell phone use while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year.\" In society people will point the finger to teenagers, but what the world must understand is that everyone plays a big role in this destruction.\\n\\nLaw enforcement officials have tried to crack down on the problem of texting and driving or just occupying a phone in general. This is very hard because they\\'re people out there that use their phones to navigate where they\\'re going but this could also be a distraction. Also, a police officer can\\'t catch every person that they see using a phone while driving and it\\'s not legal to just suspect and pull someone and ask them for their phone. So, in that case there is not much law enforcement officials can do. I believe that law officials should give people warnings and if a car accident is caused by someone not paying attention to the road they should be arrested, because they\\'re putting someone else\\'s life in danger as much as their own. Driving classes that prepare you to take on the road should talk about this subject more and show the numbers of people being killed from accidents caused by phones.

For example, taking your eyes off the road to read a text or something of that sort it increases the risk of you crashing, driving of the road, etc...Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.

Now the reason I say people should have their phones is in case of emergency like if they get in a car crash or if they have to call 911 to help someone. in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car . so I'm both with and against with this argument about if drivers should and shouldn't have their phones while driving    \",\n",

Using a phone while driving should NOT even be debatable. The consequences that could come with that are way too dangerous. It could cause distractions, an accident or even worse, death. Being in any of those situations could be very harmful not just to you but the others in the car with you. The government should get involved by making laws.\\n\\nUsing phones while driving should be illegal everywhere.\\n\\nTo begin with, using your phone while driving could cause a distraction. For example, if you're driving and there's an ambulance or a police officer trying to get through because of an emergency, the driver may not hear or see the sirens because they are distracted on their phone. Someone could be critical conditions in the ambulance but can't get the hospital because of the person that's distracted on their phone. Sometimes you have to use your phone for an emergency. Just wait till you get to your destination. Cell phone distractions can also cause problems to a pedestrian or even a driver that is swerving. Being distracted by a cell phone is similar to being drunk and driving.\\n\\nAnother consequence that it could have is an accident could occur. It could be the slightest accident but its still considered an accident. Which means someone has to call the cops to report the accident and the cop will take at least 45-60 minutes just to arrive which is a waste of time and money because if it was your fault your insurance cost rise up 60+ more a month. Depending on what the driver already pays it could be way more. That's just for a slight accident. All of that for using your mobile device.\\n\\nLast but not least, the use of your phone while driving can cause death. The driver could be so distracted that they are unaware of how fast they are driving. If you get into a head on accident at a high speed it can cause death or even crashing into a tree at high speed it can do the same. If you have others in the car with you, you're putting others lives at danger. That could affect the people that love you and love them as well. All of that because you forgot to shoot someone a text back.\\n\\nYes, we get it, sometimes using your phone while you're driving is needed for an emergency. Don't just use it to text your friends back or to put music on. Do all that before you take off. Because remember all the bad things that could happen just for using your phone while driving.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nDrivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers may need to use their phones in order to know how to get where they're going. There might also be an emergency in which the driver needs to use his/her phone to call for help. While drivers shouldn't be scrolling through social media while driving, they should be able to use their phones as needed.\\n\\nDrivers use their phones as a gps device to figure out how to get to their desired location. Studies show that only seven percent of the 220 million cars in the United States have a built in gps navigation system. This means that drivers must find another way to get directions. The maps app on their phone not only gives directions, but it reads the directions out loud so that the driver is not staring at their screen while driving. Using a phone as navigation while driving is the safest alternative to having a built in car gps.\\n\\nFurthermore, drivers need to use their phones to call for help in the case of an emergency. Emergencies are bound to happen, especially while you're operating a vehicle. Today's technology allows drivers to make calls using limited screen time and/or voice activation. This gives drivers access to using their phones while driving without causing them to take their eyes off the road. Having access to make emergency calls while operating a vehicle can help save the lives of many drivers and their passengers.\\n\\nSome might argue that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. However, every driver at one point or another is going to use their phone while driving. Regardless of the reason, it is inevitible. While drivers should not be scrolling through social media and sending texts while behind the wheel, they should have the right to make emergency calls and use gps through their phones. Drivers should be given limited access to their phones while driving.\\n\\nAll in all, drivers should be given the right to use their phones while operating a vehicle. Phones can be used by drivers as a navigation system to help them get places safely. Phones can also be used to make calls in case of emergencies. All things considered, drivers should be allowed to use their phones to a certain extent while driving.\\n\\nMiranda 2            \",\n",

They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence.\\n\\nFirst of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. (Hilbert 24) Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text \"This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.\"(Hilbert 30) This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, \"Cellular phones, and other in-vehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving.\" (Delashmit 160)\\n\\nPhones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children.\\n\\nSecondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text \" For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes (65 percent of near-crashes).\" (Delashmit 150) If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author \"These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.\"(Greydanus 92) If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving.\\n\\nFinally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text \"The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for in-vehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.\"(Hilbert 153) This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone.\\n\\nA test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where \"Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, & Crouch (2006), for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 g/dL, though the specific impairments of each group differed.\" This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence.\\n\\nAlthough some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text \"These laws take several forms: Some require drivers to use a hands-free device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.\"(Guerin 163) As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad.\\n\\nWorks Cited Page\\n\\nDelashmit, Geraud, and Henri Be´dard. Accidents?: Causes, Analysis and Prevention. Nova Science Publishers, Inc, 2009.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn 2015, the United States started to focus on the problem that was phone use while driving. Distracted driving has taken many innocent lives. According to enddd. com 37,416 lives were lost in 2016 due to distracted driving. No matter how much the death rate rises people still use their phones while operating a vehicle. Most people have the argument that having a phone mounted so they could have two hands on the wheel eliminates the problem. However, the level of danger is still high. There are opinions that the use of cell phones while driving have little to no negative effects, but there is much more compelling evidence that it is a serious hazard to be distracted while driving.\\n\\nWhile driving with other motorist around, it is imperative to keep all focus on the road. The smallest mistake could lead to a major accident including people that were not involved. In 2012 alone, 3,328 people were killed in distracted driving crashes, a number that continues to go up (Distraction. Gov). As technology advances they rate of distracted driving increasing. It has been uncovered that people between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of distracted driving. Text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted (Distraction. Gov).\\n\\nOn the contrary, it is understood that a phone might need to be used in a state of emergency. However, answering to an emergency can cause one of your own. Imagine being in a state of panic and stress with the addition of cell phone use while driving. Now there is another state of peril. It's better to get to the emergency than not getting there at all.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people are still being severely injured and even killed because of drivers distracted by phones. People walk through and across the streets scared for their lives, wondering if they will make it to their destination. How many deaths must occur before people realize how dangerous their actions can be? No one will ever know the real answer How many children are going to have to lose their parents, or for that matter, how many parents are going to have to lose their children before this danger can be stopped? No one will ever know the answer. All that can be done, as of now, is to try the best ways that can be done.            \",\n",

       " 'In today\\'s world, almost everyone has a smart phone. People should not use their phones while driving because phones are known for being a distraction. Moreover, consider your passengers. Also it is Illegal to use your phone. People do not understand the risk they put themselves in. The most dangers place to use it is in the car.\\n\\nUsing the phone while driving is one of the leading cause of death in America. Phones are supposed to help make communication easier, but instead using it causes a distraction. When the phone vibrates, the driver normally looks down at the phone to see what notification they just received. By checking the phone, everything can go wrong in the seconds it takes the driver to check.\\n\\nIt can cause an accident and it takes up to much time and money to fix the car. Not all accidents end lightly like some accidents can kill people.\\n\\nThe passengers also need to feel safe and conferrable in the car. If the driver is using their phone while driving with the passenger(s) and the driver gets into a wreck, not only does the driver get hurt but also dose the passenger(s). Sometimes the wrecks can get horrible and neither of them make it out alive. Other times the driver makes it and the passenger(s) do not. It is also possible that the passenger(s) could get nervous, reacted in a bad way, and make the situation a lot worse. Sometimes people do not realize how things can go from good, too bad, too worse in a couple of seconds.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use the phone while in the car. They put the hands free law. Now drivers can no longer have phones \"touching any part of their body\". If the driver is stopped by a cop, and they are on their phone. They face a $50 fine and goes up every time the cop stopes them. Georgia is the 16th state to pass such a hands-free law.\\n\\nPeople need to understand that phones are dangerous. They are a distraction and they are a safety issue. If people do not know how to control themselves and not use it then the law was rightfully placed. People kill others and die every day because of them not paying attention to the rode. Driving is like a war because its life or death.                         ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nSmart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.\\n\\nThe Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation.

       " 'The notion that cell phones should be used while on the road is very disturbing and quiet unacceptable. Recent studies show that cell phones on the phone increase the potential rate of brain tumors. If your distracted on the road, Car accidents may happen. Things could go wrong leaving you with unnecessary money spent and heavy bills.\\n\\nThese are the factors that have lead up to cell phones not being a good decision when it comes to safety and driving on the road.\\n\\nIn this day and age, mobile phones have become very addictive and hard to put down. While young teens drive on the road, all the focus often tends to go to a snapchat or Instagram post, not only do addictive habits lead to car accidents but students will also see a downfall in studies and other extra circular activates. Phones can often be helpful for the use of gps and other driving apps but could cause a huge accident if not handled by the right person.\\n\\nDue to the brightness of the phone, it often leads to health issues, Long hours of your eyes being exposed to the screen could lead to temporary loss of sight witch is never good. Also, headaches occur when most people are on the phone to much long hours often affect the ears witch leads to more problems occurring then normal. Scientist have shown that the more time we spend on our phones the more time are bodies are being affected. Things like slouching or leaning could lead to permit neck issues and back sprains.\\n\\nWhen your addicted to a phone driving and using the phone becomes a very hard. There is a new law in Georgia that says if you on on your phone while you are driving you will receive a ticket. Which is a good law and one that was very needed. There should be a law for that everywhere in the united states to help drivers so that they can avoid car accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these are the factors that have lead up to phones on the road being a huge mistake.

When driving all you attention should be on what's in front of you not what's on your phone. That split second look down at your phone could be fatal, cause you don't know what's going on around you and you could hit someone or run off the road. In some states it's against the law to drive while on your phone, the consequences are severe and could handicap you from some jobs.\\n\\nDriving with a phone is not okay unless it's being used as a navigation tool. Texting and driving isn't something that should be common it's a distraction . Calling is okay if its hands free calling and you can still stay focused on the road and talk at the same time. Things will not change teens are still going to disobey what the law says and drive with their phones in hand without a care in the world unless the law enforcement cracks down on it.\\n\\nAll in all teens should not be driving with the possession of their phone.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nThere is a growing discussion debating whether people should be able to use their phone while driving or not be able to. Considering there\\'s an average increase in car accidents since phones added all the features to text,games or watch movies but the phone is also a good access for people to navigate to their destination by wia gps. To continue with those topics people shouldnt be able to use their Device whether it\\'s in hands free mode or not. It\\'s too dangerous and a big risk.\\n\\nAlthough, Having a phone can result in car accidents it most definitely helps when it comes to the navigation factor of trying to get to your destination. Whether it\\'s the gps notify the driver there is another car accident ahead or heavy traffic. The end result which convinces most of the argument to side with the phone is that it helps the driver get to their destination faster.\\n\\nEven Though, phones make it such a difficult topic to debate whether people should even be allowed to have phones on while driving but again not only do they help with getting to your destination quicker but it also can make people business better a lot of people answer the phone in the car and most of all those car have hand free mode which technically make the phone safer. ALthough phones get you yo your destination quicker it also has gotten so bad that the law made it illegal as stated \" Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdiction has made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal\".\\n\\nAlso , On the other hand it was found cars with the hands free mode are as dangerous if your device is on hand on mode which gets this argument rolling the article found states; \" the obvious implication is that hands-free phone calls may be almost as dangerous as a hand-held call. This danger is less obvious to the public, especially as a ban on hand-held calls can be seen to support the \"safer\" hands-free alternative\".(David Crundall)\\n\\nTo conclude, Driving with hand free mode can be equivalent to having hand held while driving but considering the quote/article from David crundall it proves people shouldn\\'t be able to use their Device whether it\\'s in hands free mode or not. It\\'s too dangerous and a big risk.                  ',\n",
       " \"Required Essay: Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones were introduced in the United States in 1980 by engineer Martin Cooper. Since then cell phones have grown massively. More than 65% of Americans operate a cell phone. One main reason for the growth of popularity is that cell phones give us the ability to reach any person in a matter of seconds almost effortlessly. The technology of the cell phone has dramatically changed, for example Apple and their extraordinary enhancements to their devices over time. Cell phones are a necessity but not before your life or anyone else's. More than 1.5 million deaths occur a year due to cell phone use while driving. Cell phones should never in any case be more important than the road while you are driving. Drivers should definitely know to never use cell phones while driving, especially for a text.\\n\\nCell Phones provide communication with convenience, but they also have many other perks including cameras,games, etc. Cell phones can have many different uses, all of which can be very useful but at the right time. There are multiple ways in which a driver can be distracted while driving. They include talking to passengers, lighting up a cigarette and smoking,eating and drinking, etc. None of these have caused more deaths than distraction by cell phone in the USA. It is important to note that distracted driver attention by mobile phones means driving and talking at the same time, which raises safety threats. Drivers have to control both the vehicle and the mobile phone which makes focusing on the road a lot more difficult.\\n\\nDrivers who use cell phones while driving not only endangers themselves but also other people on the road. As a result, most governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland and many more have created strict policies on phone use during driving. Due to lack of attention, drivers react slowly to traffic signals, sometimes missing. Decision making during driving is very important. Being distracted gives drivers a fraction of a second to make a quick decision in an intense scenario. Studies have highlighted that cell phone drivers react a lot slower and are more likely to make a mistake on the road.\\n\\nDue to the statistics it can be concluded that, despite being a revolutionary way of communication, the use of cell phones during driving distracts the attention of the driver dramatically and puts lives at risk.                                                \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nFirst, cell phones and humans are like a duo and used by them almost every day. Humans and cars are also another duo or like a duo. But, people phones and cars and or driving? That personally is not a good idea. That is what I will be explaining in this essay. Is it or it is not a good idea to be texting and driving at the same time? Many different opinions from different people but, here is mine.\\n\\nNext, have you ever been on a road with more than one lane and the person next to you is looking down on their device? Ask yourself do you think that is safe? Operating a cell phone is okay, and is done on a daily basis. People often think that since they have been texting and driving for long periods of time that they are experts and can do it with no problem. When in reality anything can happen at any moment you look down at your device, and it is certainly not safe.\\n\\nThen, one of the number one causes of death in the world is car accidents. Usually it comes from texting and driving or even a drunk driver. Texting and driving is not safe and people should NOT be able to operate a vehicle and use cell phones. Why? Because, people die every day from a car accident either because of a device or drinking and driving. I believe that it will decrease the number of crashes and save many lives.\\n\\nTherefore, Driving and texting should not be allowed. Very dangerous and you have a high risk of losing your life and others in your car and around your car. If you are in a vehicle your phone should not even be your main focus, because the road should have all of your attention. It is better to be safe than sorry on the road, and help prevent many accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion,\\n\\nI think phones and driving should NOT happen together. I mean as in texting and driving at the same time. It has been a law but is barely followed by anyone. Many people will still text and drive but, for people who care about other they will follow this law. Maybe even one day they will prevent someone else from losing their life.                  ',\n",
       " 'Phones were created to alert people if a crisis were about to begin or to contact loved ones from far away for long periods. Over the years, phones have since upgraded into cell phones that can fit anywhere. They are very efficient and much lighter to carry around. Cell Phones nowadays help get minds off of certain things that disturb daily lives by entertaining the brain. Some people argue that cell phones help with safety issues but that\\'s far from the truth because cell phones lead to serious accidents and communication problems on the road.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones on the road because it causes a lack of focus and leads to serious accidents. This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time. For example, \"the major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts the attention of the driver\" (Scotti, 2007). This leads to putting the passenger at risk of injury. Along the same lines, this can be very dangerous if the driver has earbuds in his or her ear. For instance, \"cell phones reduce the driver\\'s performance\"(Gravelle, 2005). The driver can be impaired and no longer able to hear what\\'s going on, which can lead to confusion on the roads and cause the driver to make the wrong turn.\\n\\nSome may argue that texting while driving is dangerous and may lead to serious injuries but, that\\'s the opposite. Texting has proven to be the quickest way of getting work finished without having to be in the office or the school building. It\\'s a great help with accessing the shops online rather than using a map. For example, \"using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic\" (Sturnguist, 2006). In the same way, this makes it easier to decide on what outfit to wear that day. Not only does it help with weather issues it can also help with navigating the quickest way from accidents. However, driving while having a cellphone in hand is still against the law, and can lead to suspension or worse jail time. People on the road believe that if they wear their seatbelt, it can protect them from accidents but this is only half correct. It provides the passenger with somewhat of a small chance of protection but a higher risk with or without it on. Studies have highlighted that \"drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decisions causing serious accidents involving other vehicles\" (Gravelle, 2005). This is the main reason why cell phones shouldn\\'t be in your hands while driving. As an example, especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation and pay less attention to these areas, increasing the risk of fatal accidents.\\n\\n(Gravelle, 2005) Along the same lines, people need to stop having cellphones in hand. It\\'s going to cause suffering later.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it leads to serious accidents. These accidents could lead to paralyzation or death. The fact that people still do this is scary. It\\'s highly dangerous and risky to be doing this at all. Hopefully, in the future, they will create some type of equipment to detect people with phones in hand, because if they don\\'t more drivers and their passengers may face death and destruction.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nWaking up from a wonderful dream, you look around to what you can describe as your dull or gloomy-like room. Without even realizing, you\\'ve already picked up your phone and start to browse your social media. You check the time and go look outside your window and it looks like a wonderful day. You quickly decide to blast your music and dress up fashionably before you go out to your friend\\'s place. Alast you finish by taking many, many selfies and videos and then share them all to your friends and a few social media platforms while getting in the car. Now you\\'ve started the car and are now on the way to your friend\\'s house as planned before. On your drive, text messages start to ring your phone a lot and people try calling you. Meanwhile you are on the highway. Mind you, you just started driving two weeks before, so you\\'re practically new to this.\\n\\nAt this point you only have two options, are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? You want to convince yourself that it may be an emergency but is it really a smart decision to fiddle with that device while driving? Let alone on a highway at about 75 mph? Which leads to the topic of this essay, whether or not a driver should use their cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIn general, cell phones are a huge distraction to society itself. Some in a good way, such as passing by time. But some in a dangerous way, such as operating a vehicle. Let\\'s talk about how dangerous this is. According to research, reasons you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle is pretty obvious. It\\'s dangerous in numerous ways, as little as two second distraction is just enough to see who\\'s calling and texting your cell phone but it\\'s also just enough time to get you into a crash and cause chaos. Those few moments of looking at your phone rather than the road you\\'re moving far and even enough to where you wouldn\\'t see any pedestrians, motorcycles/bikes, or another person unexpectedly braking in front of you. Apparently stats show that cell phone use while operating a vehicle has increased with an added fact that 18 to 29 years olds are more than likely to be the people trying to access phones while driving. While that age group tends to have the high frequency of doing so, research supports that the age group over 65 have the lowest frequency. It wouldn\\'t even be smart to use a phone at traffic lights. You may fail to go at the green light and that\\'s when the illegal part comes in. There are tremendous amounts of consequences that can happen from driving all being, punishable or harmful.\\n\\nIn comparison, many other people may disagree and say that using a phone could be helpful. Based upon research, people claim there are great benefits to using your cell phone while driving. People feel they can use cell phones while driving safely with the help of hands-free technology. With laws banning hands-on behind the wheel impacting regions, drivers are saying that it\\'s the typing of letters which takes too long that makes it dangerous. Even though people using hands-free devices and hands-on devices are equally bound to end up in a car accident, hands-free drivers tend to get fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than drivers using hands-on cell phones. More research states that pros of using a cellphone are for lifeline, navigation, cameras, traffic reports, and crime reporting. Drivers may need lifeline for road-side assistance for problems like car accidents where time is tight or paramedics and other emergency contacts that may be needed. Navigation assists drivers in locationing and maps providing real-time traffic reports, this supports the hands-free benefit of cell phones by a lot because it is very much needed. Cameras are important for quick situations such as car crashes. The person may need to hurry and catch a picture of the licence plate of whom might be performing a hit and run. Traffic reports provide drivers with up-to-date traffic updates on traffic jams, highway closings, and accidents. And lastly crime reporting for suspicious and illegal actions a driver may have spotted. With research it\\'s clear many drivers can support that there are ways to operate vehicles while driving safely.\\n\\nIn my opinion, there shouldn\\'t necessarily be any use of a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It\\'s very dangerous and can cause people to be harmed badly and even bring death upon people. I feel that bluetooth music, texting, and calls, are not an excuse to grab the phone while driving. All texts and calls can wait because little do you know your life\\'s on the line especially when your vehicle is moving at any type of speed. And music can be changed within good time management. I understand that people may have jobs that may require them to use their phones while driving and that\\'s where advanced technology takes place. Advanced technology is allowing vehicles to assist drivers for safety or the vehicle may even drive itself. Hands-free cell phone usage has been promoted but now more safely than ever in this generation but I still feel that even all of the hands-free technology can even be quite an amount of distractions. Mind you one of the biggest and important rules of driving is to focus on the road. It may be hard sometimes considering that at young ages cell phones are practically habitual and it\\'s almost like we need them for everything. Notice how in the introduction I brought how a cell phone is being used. That was to show how big of a role a cell phone plays in our lives, and me mentioning being a new driver was to have a bigger as to why the phone shouldn\\'t be used. Using a cell phone while driving is very, very dangerous to you, and even others in some cases.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if causing harm and chaos is the last thing you want, the suggestion should be to not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Hands-free may sound great and all but it can be just as risky as hands-on cell phones. Surely the messages and calls being received can wait until after your drive. There is no need to add on top of stats like accidents because of cell phones.

       " \"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. You Should always want the best thing for you safety. Cell phones distracts the driver from the road. It could cause an accident and potentially kill you. Texting and driving is also illegal in almost every state.\\n\\nBeing on a cell phone while driving distracts you. You can lose focus on the road and swerve into a different lane and cause an accident. Being distracted can cause you to miss a turn you were supposed to make. A car in front of you can make a sudden stop and if you're on your phone you wouldn't have a quick reaction.\\n\\nBeing on a cell phone while driving could have you in a very bad accident and you could potentially die. Continuously looking down at the phone and the road is difficult. The roads are not a straight path and looking at the phone you wouldn't be able to realize that your driving a slight curve and you swerve into another lane, then you look up and see that your in two lanes you try to swerve back into your lane and a car was coming up on the side of you and now your in an accident.\\n\\nCops be on almost on every corner, and in undercover cars. If they see and realize you're on your phone they will pull you over and write you a pricey ticket. Some cops are petty and will put you in handcuffs. Others can be generous and let you off with a warning, but that doesn't make it okay to keep doing.\\n\\nThese reasons are why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phone behind the wheel. It increases the risk of an accident. It decreases the driver's awareness. It also distracts the drivers. It also worries the passengers because your putting their life in danger as well as yours         \",\n",
       " \"Phone & Driving Required Essay\\n\\nIn this essay I will be talking about if people should be able to be on their cellular device while they drive or should they not be able to? In my opinion I don't think we should be able to because there are many dumb drivers without phones in their hands and the good drivers turn worse with one in their hands. More car crashes will happen and more deaths will come with it. I just don't think putting another distraction in drivers hands would be the best option for the road.\\n\\nTo start off this essay I believe having any type of electronic device while you are operating a vehicle is a distraction and can cause wrecks and deaths. No type of electronic device should be in the drivers hand only type that should be allowed is the phone holders that are legal that clip onto your A/C vents but shouldn't be texting on it only phone calls and the driver should always have both hands on the steering wheel as you drive.\\n\\nTo conclude my essay having a phone while driving is not necessary in any way. Just wait till you park somewhere or you get home to check it, because your life is more important than a text message.                                               \",\n",

Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says \"[He] came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph.\" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of \"[...] the rusty red Camaro [tailgating] the minivan full of kids.\" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person\\'s life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to.

       " \"Should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving you may ask? I believe not. In this essay, I will be explaining why drivers should NOT use their devices while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nUsing a cellular device while driving is a dangerous hazard. An expanding number of studies demonstrate that driving while at the same time chatting on a cellphone can be very distracting. However, most states have not banished handheld telephones, and none have prohibited all drivers from utilizing without hand gadgets.\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research mobile phones are driving components that reason mishaps. Studies demonstrate that a mobile phone put drivers at a four-time more serious danger of an accident. Regardless of risk, individuals still use mobile phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals.\\n\\nPeople state that hands-free set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. I any case, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing an accident and even make it worse by recommending that the conduct is protected. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing a headset can be as hazardous as holding a telephone while driving while driving that the discussions can take away attention from the drivers from concentration on the road and other drivers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if individuals don't give up the cellular devices the number of innocent people dying on the streets will increase. It is the individual's duty to not bring about their own and other individuals lives. We need to stop these reckless accidents over something that is so simple to do. Put your phones away until you reach a certain location.     \",\n",

My days are spent racing from one place to another or from one activity to another. Good bad or indifferent, I am home to sleep and re-charge in the evenings and weekends. If I didn't have a cell phone to use in my car, you might not hear from me for days. My phone is currently my co-pilot in life.\\n\\nSad but probably true.\\n\\nI am a supporter of cell phone usage while in the car.\\n\\nThe ability to use a cell phone is necessary in these times. It is a on the go kind of world. My teachers email me. I keep up with my grades. I get emails. I can check the weather. I can keep up with my friends. My phone serves as my personal trainer. I can check my bank account. In the event of an emergency, having a cell phone that can allow me to seek help, report problems and potentially save lives. The importance of a cell phone goes way beyond the option to make or receive phone calls.\\n\\nAccording to Google, in 1973 the first cell phone was portable so it could travel with you. This is a game changer. I can keep up with family and friends with the capability to use my phone on the go. Guess what? They keep up with me too. We are so busy we don't even have a home phone. With the capabilities of a cell phone, we can run our lives from where ever we are.\\n\\nMy cell phone serves as my one stop shop. It is always having everything I need with me.\\n\\nWith the advances in technology we are now able to pair our phones with our cars either by aux or blue tooth. This is genius. We don't even have to worry about holding our phone. In addition, it is hands free and voice activated. I am a law-abiding citizen and I always sync my phone after I fasten my seat belt.\\n\\nI type in my first location to my next to avoid traffic and crashes.\\n\\nWith safe phone usage, cell phones should be allowed in your car. My phone serves as my safety device and my directions. I can find gas stations easily or change my driving due to traffic.

       " 'Phones And Driving\\n\\nWe all know how it feels to be driving and receiving text from friends and or family. Its very hard to say no to yourself after you see the notification. A lot of people just tell themselves \"just real quick\" or \"just this one time\". Everyone knows that texting and driving is a bad idea but nobody knows exactly why. About 90 percent of car crashes are not due to drunk drivers or people who are speeding. But they are due to drivers like me and you who think they can do two things at once.\\n\\nAnswering these text messages takes a lot of attention off the road. As humans we can only multitask in a couple ways and they aren\\'t that good. Texting and driving causes you lose awareness of what\\'s around you. People crash most cause they don\\'t see oncoming vehicles or they don\\'t see certain things from a distance. Keeping your eyes off the road can be the difference between life or death in a car crash. It all comes down to how fast you were going and your reflexes.\\n\\ndriving doesn\\'t feel dangerous. We may recognize on a cognitive level that distracted driving is stupid, but we have no accompanying visceral feeling of fear, no associated emotion to guide our decision-making in the moment of temptation. Our brains do such a good job making us feel like we\\'re in charge that we don\\'t realize it\\'s all an illusion until it\\'s too late. If our hearts started racing as soon as our attention started to drift, we might be more inclined to stay focused.\\n\\nwe feel immune to the risks that affect other people. Researchers who study texting while driving find that their participants \"have observed others driving erratically while using a cell phone, but these participants rarely, if ever, thought that their own driving was impaired when they used the cell phone.\" And despite the fact that there is no benefit to practice (people who regularly use their cell phone while driving perform no better in studies than those with less real-life experience), the belief that we can manage persists. Consistent with this, three out of four people think they are above average drivers (a statistical impossibility). We are simply overconfident in our abilities.   ',\n",

Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.\\n\\nEmergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you\\'re on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.\\n\\nMost people don\\'t know there way round the whole entire world. It\\'s not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don\\'t want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say \"Why not just use a map\"? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?\\n\\nWeather is important while you\\'re driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you\\'re going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?\\n\\nSeeing all should of changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn today\\'s day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please. The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving. With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you\\'re not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road. There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it. One of the biggest distractions in today\\'s age is the use of cellphones. With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction. I personally feel that the use of technology should not be allowed while driving unless it is under an extreme circumstance.\\n\\nTo begin, one of the main reasons that causes cellphones to be one of the most distracting items is due to the texting and driving. According to the National Safety Council they reported that \"cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". They also reported that \"nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. There are many reoccurring issues with cellphones and driving that I\\'ll be sharing more of in this essay.\\n\\nAfter writing my first paragraph I ended off talking about the teens and cell phone use while driving situation. As the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting. However, with the teen\\'s situations there are 16-year old\\'s and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults. There was a poll made by AAA saying that \"94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway\". With this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle. I would also like to talk about the other drivers on the road. There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road. Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons. I personally have an example to give with this problem. My Cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road, speeding in the rain, and also texting while driving on top of all that. Phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of Georgia, stopping the use of them in cars, but hopefully people will start to follow that law.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.\\n\\nWorks Cited https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html 4         ',\n",
       " \"The use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed at all. People put themselves and others at risk, safety should always go first. Throughout the years cell phone use has increased a lot. People use cell phones daily, sometimes when walking you don't notice where you're going and bump into someone. That's something minor but let's say you're driving while using you're device that's major, a car accident may be caused.\\n\\nI believe cell phones should not be used while driving because it's a big distraction. Car wrecks would be avoided, which decreases the amounts of deaths. Also the person that was distracted is most likely the one to put at fault this may lead to lawsuits. Even if texting while driving were to be legal that does not mean it is safe. We should avoid all types of distractions while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason is because if you are caught using you're phone while driving by a cop or because of an accident. You're car insurance will be affected, if you were already paying a lot it's most likely that the payment will now be doubled. That could be easily avoided, another reason is that you shouldn't put at risk your passengers. It is better be safe than sorry.\\n\\nThere is a lot of reasons this should not be allowed. Safety should be taken serious. Car accidents, lawsuits, being hospitalized is not a joke, people die due to others being distracted when they're on their phones while driving. We should avoid any type of distraction while driving to avoid bad consequences.   \",\n",
       " \"I believe that drivers should not use their phones while driving. The reason behind this is that Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. In some cases restrictions are directed at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones.\\n\\nIn addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2017, 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash.\\n\\nDrivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that driving while using your mobile device should not be allowed. It is a distraction that can cause the driver and innocent bystanders to lose their lives over something that can easily be prevented.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSnyder, Edgar (2017).

I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road.\\n\\nUsing your cellphone can actually be deadly. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective.\\n\\nUsing your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe.\\n\\nWhen you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours.                                                    \",\n",
       " \"The use of cellular phones has spread substantially the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many Americans. Unfortunately, the use of cellphones for everyday life a lot of the times, takes place in cars. As a result, many accidents have taken place due to the use of cellular phones while on the road. Many people are not aware of just how serious this has become, which is why people should not be allowed to use phones in cars without a hands free device.\\n\\nThe use of phones while driving not only puts the person driving in danger, but all the people around them. It takes one person to make one decision that can affect the lives of many.\\n\\nPeople do not take into consideration the horrible facts about accidents caused by cell phones when choosing to use their phones. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. It also states that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving and 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk, but people still to this day do not think about the possible consequences of phones and driving.\\n\\nPhones are not always a bad thing in cars, when following the right protocols. They help with navigation, communication, and are vital in the event of an emergency. Many states have banned the use of using a cell phone in any manner without a hands free device, which has decreased the amount of phone caused accidents. This law, although a struggle for some to follow, ultimately has everyone's best interest. People everywhere should be educated about the dangers of cell phone use in cars and about safer alternatives, and should be punished for not using a safer solution.\\n\\nAs seen, driving while talking on the phone is very dangerous. Also, with new laws if you're caught, you can be fined and could ultimately get your driver's license suspended. People can avoid all this trouble by only talking on your mobile phone when you are parked and out of the way of traffic. It could save your life one day. The use of a hands-free kit with your mobile phone as you drive doesn't eliminate risk, as you still might be distracted, but it does help cut it down. Driving a car is dangerous enough without adding still more risk by texting or talking and it is important that people are aware of that    \",\n",
       " \"Texting/Drive\\n\\nShould you text and drive, no you shouldn't. Texting and driving is a bad thing it can cause accidents and people might die including yourself. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. Of these, 1.6 million have a cell phone involved in them. That's the majority of all road accidents in the United States. Over half the road accidents in the States have cell phones involved, and if this doesn't make you realize just how potent it is, what will. Texting and driving should not be allowed because a lot of innocent people each year die because someone wants to be on there phone.\\n\\nIn most states, texting while driving is considered a primary-enforcement violation, which means officers can issue citations any time they observe drivers texting and driving. Others have secondary enforcement, meaning officers can issue citations only if they've stopped drivers for some other offense. People can be charged for texting and driving such as Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. You also have Criminal charges, in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges Class B or C. Class B misdemeanors are punished between 90-180 days in county jail. Class C misdemeanors receive the least amount of time, usually 30 days or less.\\n\\nCell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. There are more accidents in texting and driving than all the road accidents in the U.S. each year, that's a major problem.\\n\\nI believe the penalty should stay the same time in jail and the fines that you'll receive. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Time in jail, between 90-180 days in county jail. But the major part of it is if you kill another individual person in the process, which I think you should be given major charges. Fines should be over $500 up to the $10,000 range. And time in jail should be 20 years maybe more depending on how many people you killed.\\n\\nThe conclusion to this is that Texting and driving is a major problem and we need to find ways to stop it. It's only going to get worse, because of the new technology that will be coming in the future. Even though people have habits for checking their phone they should just turn it off and focus on the road. That in all should stop the accidents in a hole, but sometimes people have import things they need to do I understand, but try to find ways to stop. You might be even saving your own life.\\n\\n2            \",\n",

You may not have gotten into an accident but for a limited time your life is completely in danger. Situations like this is why i think drivers should not use technology while operating a vehicle. Using technology while operating a vehicle because it can result in a distraction, causes of accidents, and putting others at risk.\\n\\nThere are a few people that would say they have to turn their music down to figure out exactly where their going. This is a type of distraction which is not good for the road. Distractions makes you lose focus of your surroundings while your driving. Resources shows that you are 25% more likely to look at your phone on the road if it rings. In 2015 391,00 injuries were caused by distracted driver. Distracted drivers are considered a new epidemic in america. With different technology being developed there are easier ways of people to get distracted while driving.\\n\\nUsing technology does a lot to a person while driving. Someone can gets into a really bad car accident because they are trying to answer a phone call or send a text. There are 1.6 million crashes on an annual bases. 19 people are killed daily by drivers who are texting.6-16% of all deaths in the us are caused by drivers sending or reading text messages. These deaths could easily be avoided if people don't look at or answer their phones while driving. Using technology doesn't just put yourself in danger but it puts others in danger as well. It endangers everyone around you. When you drive your life and people your in the car with live are in your hands and you shouldn't take that for granted. You have to be mindful on what you do to make sure everyone is ok.\\n\\nIn conclusion drivers should not use technology while driving because it puts everyone around them at risk. When drivers are on the road their focus should be on the road. They should not have distractions because those distractions can end someone's life in a blink of an eye. The text or call is not more important than you and the people around you lives.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over the past two decades phones and technology have expanded and so have the dangers of getting behind the wheel with a cellular device. I believe that no one has a reason to be doing anything other than driving when in a vehicle. Cellular devices have become a major issue whether you're a senior citizen or a beginner at driving.\\n\\nOver the past few years that technology has expanded into many forms more and more casualties have occurred on the roads. The United States Department of Transportation reported that cell phones are involved in about 1.6 million auto crashes each year meaning that these 1.6 million car crashes involved cellular devices being a distraction to drivers. Some of the cell phone related car crashes lead to deaths of the distracted drivers and even the people who weren't even behind the wheel. There are many different ways to be distracted by a cellular device. This includes texting, maps, email, and social media.\\n\\nEmotions over text messages could also effect a driver's state of mind while driving. If a driver were to get mad or upset over something they saw or read they could get distracted and lose control of the vehicle. Also could affect others that are driving. Other drivers could be in danger if someone can't see because they are distracted texting someone back. Overall this means that emotions could overcome someone if they used a cellular device while driving.\\n\\nThe law in Georgia is called the hands free law in my own words I think of this as both hands on the wheel. This is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel. Using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency. If an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because of the panic and only one hand to steer. I think that both hands is an important safety when it comes to driving.\\n\\nThese three major points support my reason as to why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices behind the wheel. Emotion effecting the capability of someone driving, casualties because of distractions caused by cellular devices and, two free hands that will make the possibilities of crashing slim to none.                  \",\n",

Texting and driving is an extremely dangerous act that causes major distractions, puts your life as well as others in danger.\\n\\nSince the creation of the cellphone in 1973, phones have caused distractions. The creation of text in 1992 enhanced the distractions the cellphones caused and ever since then the distractions have gotten bigger. Those distractions while doing an activity that demands so much attention such as driving can be extremely dangerous, especially texting while driving. Texting while driving makes up 1 out of 4 car accidents, leads to 1.6 million crashes a year, and causes about 400,000 injuries each year.\\n\\nCar accidents not only injure those who text and drive but it also leads to second hand effects of it. Thousands of injuries and deaths happen yearly due to distracted drivers harming others and those people could be passengers or just pedestrians. The danger for those who aren't the distracted driver are usually higher, since the passengers in the back don't have airbags and random pedestrians have no protection against the driver. Drivers shouldn't just take themselves into consideration, but also the safety of others around them.\\n\\nThe characteristics of distracted driving have been compared to their types of impairment driving. Driving such as drunk driving have been compared to distracted driving and drunk driving has even been proven to be less dangerous in some ways than distracted driving. Distracted driving had well over 100,000 more injuries than drunk driving, but drunk driving has well over 6,000 more deaths attributed towards it. The age group for distracted driving is mainly shifted towards teenagers and young adults between 18-24, rather that of the 26-29 range of drunk driving. It's been suggested that at any given point there'll be over 660,000 drivers using their phones while behind the wheel of a vehicle. States that ban cellphones at the wheel have resulted in the increase of hands free use as impaired to the states who haven't.\\n\\nThese numbers in accidents and deaths tend to go up or stagger any given year, the numbers won't go down if no ban on cellphones at wheel is placed. Teenagers are the most affected by any distractions caused by a cellphone, making them most likely to get in an accident. Distracted driving has resulted in more accidents than drunk driving and a plentiful number of unfortunate deaths. No driver, in any capacity should be allowed to drive while texting or distracted in any matter by a cellphone. It should be illegal and carrying the same punishments as a DUI would considering the number of accidents caused by such driving.\\n\\nCitations:\\n\\nhttps://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html https://arrivealivetour. com/unite/distracted-driving-vs-drunk-driving-which-is-more-dangerous/                                     \",\n",

Some even visualize a distraction that keeps their eyes off the road. There are even times drivers let their minds wander from driving. However, texting leave a driver especially teenagers to be effected by all these types of distractions.\\n\\nTeen drivers are inexperienced and ill-mannered which makes them more likely to be involved in an accident. Out of most activities related to cellphones texting is the largest cause of distracted driving. Each year almost 390,000 car related injuries are caused by a teen that was texting and driving. When answer a text at 55 mph a driver's loses attention to the road for about five seconds. This is about the same time to cross a football field.\\n\\nCell phones can be dangerous for everyone. 1 out of 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving. 21 percent of teen drivers that were in an accident were distracted by their cell phones. Even with hands free devices you could not increase safety. 94 percent of teen drivers understand the dangers of texting and driving. However, 35 percent still admit to doing it anyway.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Out of most cell phone activities texting is the most dangerous. It's every driver's job to not use any device while driving. Before, you drive any vehicle it's important to end all activates on your phone. Teens should take responsibility to drive safely and not to get easily distracted by their phones.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nCell phones are essential tools in society that humans use to perform day-to-day operations such as communicating with others, checking the weather, and researching random topics on the Internet, however there is a time and a place for everything and cell phones should not be used by drivers in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle. Cell phones are helpful in many different forms, however they also distract you from what is in front of you. To use a cell phone you need to look at it which diverts your attention from what is physically happening around you. It is dangerous to not pay attention to what is happening around you when you were driving because it puts you and others at risk for danger. If a driver is not allowed to use their phone while operating a vehicle, then you eliminate the possibility of a car accident caused by the distraction of a cellular device.\\n\\nCons of a having a cell phone in a car\\n\\nWhen driving, you need to pay attention to the road in order to get from your starting destination to your final destination safely. You can put yourself in harm's way when you are not paying attention to what you are doing. When using a cell phone in a car you are worried about what is happening on your phone and not worrying about what is happening in the world. You then have to switch back-and-forth really quickly to know what is going on in the road and what is happening on your phone. You can cause a major car accident which can result in the loss of life and you will become a murderer by law if you were distracted while driving. Drivers who cause accidents due to them being distracted by their cellular devices, are liable to those who were negatively affected in the accident and can be fine for using their cell phones in many different state. This reinforces the dangers that using a cell phone while driving hats.\\n\\nLaws for distracted driving. In order to prevent car accidents, Government officials have put laws in place to lower the use of cellular devices while driving. Government officials have concluded that many distractions do exist while driving however cellular devices are one of the major distractions that cause the most accidents across many different states. Officials have tried to come back to this distraction by making cards with hands-free technology built into the dashboards and states have made laws prohibiting cell phone use while driving. To lower car accident rates Even further, employers put pants on the use of both hands free devices and cellular devices. Ever since state and employees have placed restrictions on cell phone use while driving, statistic show that car accidents have been on a decrease every single year.\\n\\nThe confident driver. A lot of drivers will argue that since they have been driving for X amount of time or because they perform so well on their drivers test, then they should be able to use their cell phones because they do not believe that they will cause any accidents. The science says differently. Science says there are many distractions on the road well a person is driving. People cause these accidents have been driving for various different amounts of years. Some of these drivers have been driving for 10+ years and others a few months. Win drivers who are using their phones at the time of the accident report there side of the story they always say that they did not see the other persons in some way, shape, form, or fashion. That is because the average reaction time of a distracted driver is 1.5 seconds. Accident reconstruction specialist also found that the average driver reaction Breaktime was to be 2.3 seconds. And with most driving accidents, a person has between about 0.7 to three seconds to react in avoid crashing. This reaction time of a human being is greatly slow with the distraction of a cell phone which leads virtually no time for the distracted driver to correct themselves.\\n\\nDriving with phones\\n\\nDriving with the phone is very dangerous to do. Cellular devices can and will cause drivers to divert their attention from the things surrounding them. Studies show that using cellular devices while driving increases the amount of car accidents. Using a cell phone while driving will slow down your reaction time when you are put in danger while on the road. In many different states, using your phone while driving is illegal. This is why drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\n3            \",\n",
       " \"Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation.\\n\\nThis means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.\\n\\nUnfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. In conclusion cellphones are not safe to use while driving          \",\n",

Texting and driving isn't for anyone it's one of the fastest ways to end your life over one of the smallest things and we don't want that to happen. These are a few reasons texting and driving will ruin your life, drivers lose all awareness on the road and not paying attention, they lead to more crashes, and you're most likely to be at fault during an accident.\\n\\nTexting is all throughout today's society like being at fault during accidents. When you're at fault for an accident it makes your insurance premium go up and nobody wants to pay extra just over a ticket.

People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious.\\n\\nIt doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation.\\n\\nStatistics are rising fast for car accidents caused by texting and driving. We all know the love ones at home wouldn't want us to be a part of that statistic. We can change our ways and lower the statistic by simply obeying the law and being patient enough to wait to check our phones. If you don't care enough to avoid a simple mistake, then so be it. My purpose for writing this essay is so people understand how risky texting and driving is so let's make it easy for one another and not be a part of that group of people who partake in texting and driving.                                                                                                      \",\n",

       " 'Should Drivers Use Cellphones While Driving?\\n\\nCell Phones have become a prominent part of most peoples lives in this contemporary era. Smartphone ownership is growing rapidly around the world. In addition, the worlds population is 7.6 billion with an estimated 1.4 billion cars on the road. That is a vast eighteen percent of the population. This leads to the question, should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I feel as though you should not touch your phone while operating a vehicle. A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while texting and driving.\\n\\nIt maybe argued that people need their phones in dire emergencies. This is where the campaign \"It can wait\" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth.\\n\\nWhen texting and driving, your focus is mostly on your phone. Your focus is supposed to be fully on the road. Not only is there traffic, but you also must look out for pedestrians. You must be aware so that you can be able to react quickly to pedestrians that aren\\'t aware and potential accidents (due to poor judgement of other drivers). Knowing and keeping track of your speed and the speed limit is also crucial. You cannot do as listed above when fully submerged in your phone.\\n\\nAdditionally, laws are being passed to stop driving and using a cellphone in any capacity of a vehicle. If seen doing so, you will get a ticket. As of July 1st, 2019, this law was put in place in Georgia. You would also receive a moving violation. Moving violations affect auto insurance. While cellphones are very convenient, we must be able to articulate when and where to use them.\\n\\nWe are aware of places where they are prohibited (e. g.: court rooms, airplanes, movies) therefore it will take some getting used to not being on your phone at all while driving. It is not impossible, though. We can still receive phone calls, especially those very important ones, of course. As mentioned before, the Bluetooth may be hooked up to your car, therefore one may talk wirelessly whilst driving. The conversation may be heard via speakers in the car. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It can always wait.\\n\\nWorks Cited 1.) \"AT&amp;T It Can Wait: Take the Pledge to Drive Distraction Free.\" AT&amp;T It Can Wait | Take the Pledge to Drive Distraction Free, 27 Feb. 2020, www. itcanwait. com/.\\n\\n2.)\\n\\nCuffy 2\\n\\nCuffy 3                                                                                                                                                                                           ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nToday many people have cellular devices and they can be a constant problem. Some people have a habit where they look at there phone way to often, this is a problem. If someone is to be driving and they constantly look at their phones their risking their lives or maybe the lives riding in the vehicle. It is very dangerous and raises the risk of car accidents you could have. It is also illegal to text in drive because it's a safety hazard for drivers.\\n\\nPhones affect society the more they develop and we will continue to buy cellular products. We buy these to stay in touch with friends, family, and the work place or maybe you might have one for research or games. The problem with these devices are that people tend to text and drive. Texting while driving is a risky action to take while operating a vehicle. Phones are a distraction to people who drive and can't leave the phone alone. This distraction is serious it can get someone severely injured, killed or even a ticket.\\n\\nThere is a law for texting and driving that's good because it can prevent more people to stop texting and driving. The law bans cellular use while operating a vehicle so that we can prevent car crashes. This law is important without this law there wouldn't be no control on texting and driving. Most people follow the law but many more people don't. There are also certain age groups who text and drive and there are affects from the age groups.\\n\\nDifferent age groups tend to text and drive. Teens are more distracted by the devices because teens usually text friends a lot and it becomes a habit. Teens who drive are still learning to drive better and when phones distract them it raises their chance higher than other age groups because their reaction time may not be high as developed drivers. Adults with higher driving skills who text and drive still have a high risk of a car crash. They have better driving experience but it's still possible that they could crash. Crashing is a cause by not paying attention or the other person could be the one that was distracted.\\n\\nTexting and driving is as dangerous as drinking and driving. Texting and driving raises the chance of crashing six times higher than drinking and driving. Each year at least 1.6 million drivers have crashed because of being distracted at least six thousand drivers have been killed by being distracted. Drunk driving causes more than ten thousand lives per year. It doesn't matter which one is more dangerous it's still a high risk for a car accident.\\n\\nTexting and driving should not be allowed because this can get people injured or killed. To prevent texting and driving there should be more officers on the road stopping people from texting and driving this should be affective in areas where texting and driving is high. The reason I said areas where texting and driving is high is because if a lot of people text and drive in the same area not everyone is paying attention and this could cause more crashes. This will also make people know they shouldn't text and drive because the police are out to give tickets. Hopefully this idea will work permanently without having police around trying to give out tickets.\\n\\nIt's good that police give tickets to those who do text and drive, they don't do it because their picking on you they do it to help prevent you from risking your life. When a officer gives you a ticket this ticket usually comes with a fine. You have to pay this fine or there will be serious consequences. You driver license may be suspended and you won't be able to drive any where. This is bad for people who work, go to school or go places they need to be. Hopefully people will learn it's not right because it's not worth risking your life over a text you could have waited to send.   \",\n",
       " \"Cell phones are an inescapable part of modern life, providing information and connection that has become an expected part of everyone's routine. However, this becomes complicated the moment your phone and car meet. On one hand, the GPS is an essential tool for any road trip, on the other, distracted driving is dangerous, and sometimes fatal. A balance needs to be struck, one where you can drive without distractions, and still get where you need to go.\\n\\nFor many people, the use of their phone is non-negotiable. Either for location, or for podcasts and music that break the monotony of a daily commute. At the same time using one's phone has a notable impact on one's performance driving. In many states, the solution proposed is to make it illegal to touch one's phone while driving. This allows a GPS to give directions, or for a person to dictate calls or voice commands while reducing the amount of time spent looking away from the road.\\n\\nWith hands free driving, someone can still interact with their cellular device, give commands, find directions, and communicate with others while still looking at the road. With smartphones offering voice assistants, it's no longer necessary for people to directly interface with their phones, meaning people are no longer spending as much time looking down at their phones and away from the road.\\n\\nIf people were no longer allowed to use their phones on the road, while crashes may decrease, people would be cut off from a world where doing so is becoming increasingly detrimental. It would be foolish to walk away from such increasing connectivity for an extreme solution such as banning cellphones in cars. Such a ban would be an overly drastic solution to a more nuanced problem, leaving people greatly inconvenienced for the sake of a heavy handed solution.\\n\\nIf a proper balance is able to be found between reducing the distractions phones provide to drivers and maximizing the amount of benefit still available to them, it would be greatly preferable to an all out ban on the devices in cars, and would reduce road fatalities and crashes while still maintaining the accessibility and convenience smartphones provide on a daily basis. So no, phones should not be banned on roads, but they should not be unregulated either, as with many issues, it is not black and white, and to approach it as such would be to ignore the vastly superior solutions hiding in the swatches of grey between the two extremes.   \",\n",

As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.\\n\\nAlso a main reason why you shouldn\\'t operate both things at once, is simply because it\\'s illegal in some states. You don\\'t want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It\\'s definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,\"A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution\". It\\'s very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.\\n\\nThese accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car.

       " \"The Dangers of Your Cell Phone on Roads\\n\\nCommunication is something that has been given to the human race ever since the first man was coined and has been ever so crucial for our development to how we are today. We come so far as to create a device to communicate at great distances with a single tap, this device is known as a cell phone. The device has gone through many alterations time after time to satisfy the needs of the average user. Cell phones are used on a daily basis and most spend up to nine hours a day, this behavior can be described as addicting. This addiction causes many people to not be aware of their surroundings which leads to many accidents; most of accidents occur on the road. Drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones when in use of a motorized vehicle because it increases the chance for an accident and decreases focus during the ride.\\n\\nCell phones require much focus in order for one to operate it correctly, the same goes for using a vehicle so when you come across someone that is using a cellphone and a car at the same time, the chances of hitting something massively increases by almost 900 percent. The obvious reason why so many end up in an accident is because if you're in a car traveling at 60 mph then that would suggest that for every second you don't see the road you miss about sixteen meters of distance, sixteen meters is enough distance for anyone to be involved in an accident. Safety councils report that anyone operating a cellular device while driving leads to approximate 1.6 million crashes per year. Most of the crashes are generated by younger adults who are just beginning to explore the world but end abruptly caused by the foolish act of using a cell phone while driving. Some states are now combating this problem by being stricter on what is allowed in during the ride and may lead to a chain reaction for all state's decisions.\\n\\nGovernment has had enough of all vehicle users to put innocent live at risk so they have passed bans for drivers so they would be punished if they are caught using a cell phone. About sixteen states have banned all drivers to have a cell phone in hand while in use of a vehicle including the District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. In Georgia, the law has been effective since the first of July last year (2018) and with the ban in place, less drivers are causing accidents because of the incentive to pay 50 dollars on their first conviction. This is a very good method for reducing the amount of people getting into crashes, it gives the tempting drivers to stop using their cell phone while driving. There are many more reasons why you should not use a cell phone during a use of a vehicle but these are two that could be major in rank.\\n\\nMany people use the skill that was given to us since birth and communicate with others around the world, it is very useful and can grow your social life as well as your culture. Many take advantage of this and use their cell phones while driving and putting many lives at risk including theirs, hopefully this helps other in grasping the seriousness of doing such action and will rethink how they drive. When someone calls you while you're driving please be smart and don't use your cell phone, this is why you shouldn't use your cellphone during the use of a vehicle.            \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nShould people be able to use their phones in any capacity while driving? They should. Should people have complete access to their phones while driving? No, some of the features on phones should not be accessible while driving. Is there danger with using a phone while driving? Yes, there is, but the danger is in most of what is done on a regular day basis.\\n\\nWhy should people have accessibility to phones while driving? People should be able to because it is their property. Someone can not deny someone the usage of something they bought with their own money. A salesman can't sell someone a fork and plate and tell them not to eat. The salesmen can tell the consumer the ups and downs of their product. Then it becomes that person´s choice or whether or not they want to take that risk. It is all about personal limits.\\n\\nStating that danger shouldn't be prevented is idiotic. But someone's argument against something should not be the dangers of it. Everything, including phones and driving, are dangerous in themselves, but the more they are done, the worst they get. With this being known, would someone try to prevent people from drinking water because some people have died from doing so. No, they would allow them the knowledge of the dangers and allow them to set their limits. The exact same thing should be done for phones while driving.\\n\\nThis essay keeps stating that to limit the person's usage. Nothing can be entirely prevented because people will do as they please. But if you set limits, more people are subjectable to follow such limits. They are even more willing to do so knowing the dangers or consequences of their actions. Finally, let people govern themselves. It is not one person´s nor is it a group of people´s choice on whether someone can or cannot do something.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.\\n\\nSo the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.      \",\n",

It can be very dangerous. Did you know it can be more dangerous than drinking and driving?\\n\\nUsing a cell phone while driving can be harmful because you are not looking on the road and you are looking at your phone so you do not know what is going on around you. Also you can cause somebody else life that is doing the right thing while you are doing the wrong thing on the road. For an example you can be behind somebody and what if they press the breaks hard or stop and you do not know you just think they kept going ad you are on your phone and then boom car accident and it's going to be your fault because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road and then you have to pay for somebody else car damage and yours so the outcome would not look good for you either way. Another thing is you can get pulled over by a police and lose your license.\\n\\nAnother reason you should not text and drive is because you can end up seriously injured or probably killed. For an example in 2010 30,296 are deadly killed and 2,239,000 injured people that has been in a crash because of using their cell phones. People do not realize it can happen to them until they do it because people think it's not but when it does they can say nothing or if they are injured they are going to tell their friends and family do not do it and stuff like that and how it's not safe because they realize it's not nothing to be joking around with. Another reason driving and texting is not safe is you can get a ticket by the police officer. Also your car insurance will be more than what you are probably paying now and it might be hard for you to obtain it and stuff like that if you got other stuff you have to pay for.\\n\\nUnless you want to end up in a wheelchair or in the hospital do not text and drive wait until you get in a rest area or pull over to the side if it is that important. Therefore, do not text and drive or there will be consequences.                   \",\n",

Kids are too attached to their phones and having a car at a young age today is an immediate risk one text message and they instantly have to read the message and at that moment it could be over. Cell phones should be put away while driving or on a phone holder just to keep things safe. All attention should be on the road and if needed a person can easily pull over and make a call.\\n\\nJust put down the phone that one message or missed call can wait its not worth your life.

There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. This will lead to lower accidents in the u. s.\\n\\nWe all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. There are nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving. The reason its it so high because people are convinced that texting and driving isn\\'t dangerous, we need us humans to realize that lives matter so we need to reflect on risks.\\n\\nOn the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that \" Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving\". Meaning you will get a ticket and i\\'m pretty sure that nobody wants to get a 150-250 dollar ticket for doing something stupid. It\\'s really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they\\'re not on the phone.\\n\\nPeople often feel like they will miss something and separated from the world when they aren\\'t on their phone. So many many lives have been taken just because a single text or a single call. Thousands are dying and being injured. So no cell phones shouldn\\'t be able to be used while driving.      ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nDuring the past few years, phones become very popular in the world. Every generation has a telephone. A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. Phones are taking over the world, and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones. Knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive, we still do it; 90 % of you agreed to have texted while driving. I'd be lying if I said I had never texted while driving. But I recognize the dangers, and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident. It doesn't matter what commercials we seen, or what car accident we have witness, we still text and drive and it's a fact.\\n\\nIn this generation, texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents, especially for teenagers. A lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving. Most people think texting and driving are underrated. Some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well. So they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive. People really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life. Texting and driving is a serious hazard, which could ultimately cost you your life or others. This pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it.\\n\\nAnd most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of 18-25.\\n\\nNot only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself, many people compare the danger level to drunk driving. Driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal, just as some believe texting while driving should be as well. Drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day. If people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are, it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel. All of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous. Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.\\n\\nIt is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but the majority of drivers continue doing so. Even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving, teens and adults are still texting at the wheel. Overall I think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving. People should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them, because I know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone, and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost. If people follow that rule, I think the rate of a car accident would decrease, and people would be alive and well. Today, texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving. You are 23 times more likely to have an accident if you are texting.\\n\\nA phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. For this reason, many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others. In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people. Leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's, that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home.                                     \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phone usage while driving is one of the most causes of accidents to young teen drivers. In the United States,motor vehicle accidents due to distracted driving is increasing. While most people are aware of the risk of using a cell phone while driving, they still continue to take the risk anyway.. Texting while driving causes a 40 percent increase in accidents because of the time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.\\n\\nDriving is not something to play around with especially for young drivers. It\\'s responsibility to them and putting trust from their parents/guardian to not be in any big accidents. Because of how much death that have been occurred from the cell phones, they have legally made a law about the use of cellphones. Since then the toll numbers of death especially to young drivers have been dropped. Even though the bars have been drop we still got those kind of people who don\\'t care about the law and still take risk their own lives with texting or being on the web while driving.\\n\\nAs a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can\\'t put down our cell phones. As each year go by I can see that the government are doing their best to reduce the death toll of car crashes but one more title they soon gotta check up on is the deaths from drunk driving because they are the 2nd most cause of deaths in car crash just from drinking and driving.\\n\\nTherefore, I believe that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Just recently in 2018 Georgia has just made a law called the \"Hands-Free-Law\". Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rule even tapping \"play\" on a Spotify playlist while not parked, face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second offense. Everything I have discuss result to me disagreeing to having phones while driving.                                                  ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell phone use while driving has become the largest cause of automobile crashes over the last two decades. Using a phone while driving can cause distracted driving and even worse car accidents with fatalities. With drivers being distracted, it decreases their awareness on the road and leads to more car crashes. According to the United States Department of Transportation, in 2017, distracted driving claimed 3,166 lives in that year alone. Mobile phone use while driving distracts drivers in two ways; physically and cognitive distraction. Although many laws have been set in place in order for cell phone usage while driving to be banned, many ignore the law and still use cell phones. With this information being concluded, many feel as if drivers should not be able to use cellular phones while driving in any capacity.\\n\\nThere are many benefits from decreasing the number of drivers who choose to use their cell phone while driving.\\n\\nIn different states there are different cell phone law variations, but all do the same, they intend to prevent drivers from driving distractedly. Although, these laws are set in place, many do not adhere to and follow these laws. Furthermore, no state has banned the use of cell phones while driving, just adamant enforcement and strict restrictions. For example, fifteen states enforce the handheld cell-phone use law, which prohibits all drivers from using hand-held devices or cell-phones while driving. In addition to laws being put in place, if caught being on a cell-phone while driving, there are fines put in place.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there are many precautions that should be followed to prevent the use of cell phones while driving. Firstly, keeping your cell phone out of arm's length reach it should prevent the use of it. Secondly, if in a situation where a text message must be sent out, do it before driving and let whoever is being texted that you will be unreachable for a certain amount of minutes. Also, silencing a cell phone could be the difference in a life or death situation. Lastly, simply just keeping your focus on the road and not anything else could save a life.\\n\\nAlthough cell-phones have detrimental effects on driving, they also have helpful factors as well. Many cell-phones have GPS systems that many people use while driving. Also, rideshare companies use cell-phones as a way to find riders and the drivers even use their cell-phones for GPS reasons. Furthermore, cell phones allow their users to make calls in the case of an emergency. For example, in the case of a serious car accident, where time is of the essence, cell phones are there for paramedics to be contacted immediately. Lastly, being able to use your cell phone while driving, permits you to be able to call authorities if they witness suspicious activity they have seen while driving.\\n\\nFinally, using your cell-phone while driving has its' pros and cons. More importantly, its' cons. Cell phone related car accidents and fatalities continue to increase despite the legal legislative action by the states' government that prohibit specific cell phone related activities while driving. Regardless of the educational attempts about the risk of distracted driving and cell phone use to warn the general public, many refuse to abide by the law. In conclusion, drivers, in any capacity should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.                                                                                                                                                  \",\n",

We use cell phones for everything we do day to day such as Texting, Talking, Gaming. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person.\\n\\nIt is observed that the use of mobile phones during driving, despite an effective means of communication, contributes to an interruption of the driver's attention which increases issues concerning road safety. Drivers that use cell phones could never pay full attention to roads that expose not only themselves but also other people on the road. The research team's results showed that the use of cell phones makes drivers quite exposed to serious crashes while driving. The driver's main emphasis is not on the road or traffic, and even at one time trying to handle the phone and vehicle becomes difficult. During driving, cell phones also reduce drivers' mental capacity, as they fail to focus on minor or major activities that occur around them. Drivers that use cell phones respond slowly and very often make wrong decisions that can trigger fatal accidents affecting other passenger cars. Driving decision making is a vital factor in giving drivers a split second to make a fast decision.\\n\\nAlthough there are serious negative impacts of using cell phones while driving, it is also relevant to present advantages for the sake of arguments. The security factor is again the most important benefit of cell phones during driving. Cell phones can provide help during emergencies and drivers can make emergency calls, even reporting any hazardous scenarios such as roadside accidents. A driver can locate the desired route via cell phones. Besides, any use of FMs on cellular phones may provide weather and traffic information. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person. There are other ways to distract a driver than cell phones such as talking to passengers, cigarette lighting and smoking, eating, drinking, emergencies presented justifications from both sides of an issue using cell phones during driving, and not using them.\\n\\nThe paper raised points on both sides of the issue using mobile phones while driving, or not using them. I proposed that using cell phones is very dangerous while driving a vehicle because they cause you to lose your distraction while driving and they can cause a serious accident.

A crash could be in a spilt second by you taking your eyes off the road.\\n\\nIf you're ooking at your phone texting, you could swerve and cause a wreck that can hurt you and other.

One example of why cell phones should not be used because they take the person is attention off of the road. The usage of a cellular device is dangerous especially when it comes to operating a vehicle. People using a phone will be too focused on it and that could lead to an accident.\\n\\nFines have been placed as a consequence for cell phone usage. The fines are to get fewer people to use their phones, but it really is not much of a help. Many think they should be able to use their phones so the fines do not really mean much to them. For example, people say if you do not pay this phone bill then you shouldn't be able to tell me what to do with it. In the other case many people do it without thinking about what could happen and how it could greatly effect themselves or the people around.\\n\\nSuspension of license is also another consequence of driving while using cell phones. There is so much that can be looked over but it only takes that one time to do it to the point where you are affected. Some people will abide by the rules of driving without the use of a cellular device while there are some who do not. Everyone cannot be spoken for, although the majority can be put into the category of people who use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the usage of cell phones has many reason as to why it shouldn't be allowed. In my opinion, it is better to be safe than sorry in any situation that deals with driving. The life is of yourself and others is what really matters at the end of the day.

There are laws saying that it is illegal for you to be texting and driving.\\n\\nIf you were to cause an accident because you were texting and driving and end someone's life because of that accident you will be held responsible for that person's death and will actually serve time in jail or in prison. Throughout most of the states of the United States of America it is actually very illegal for someone to be texting and driving.\\n\\nYou will actually be charged if you get pulled for texting and driving because you are risking your life and the lives of others on the road.\\n\\nI personally think that it shouldn't be something people should be doing in general. Mostly because the lives of others are at stake when someone is texting and driving and could actually lose their life because of it. It distracts the driver from focusing on the road and so many things could go wrong on the road whether there is a drunk driver or construction. Texting isn't as important as your life and the lives of other people.\\n\\nTexting and driving isn't something people should or do in general. Luckily there's laws saying to not text and drive but some people don't listen and there is still risk of accidents happening because of this. People should see the bad side of texting and driving rather than answering someone's text message.       \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones and driving is not a good combination. See when you're driving you have to pay attention because your life and others depend on it. Therefore, having a cellphone would make that task difficult because it is a distraction. Using your cellphone while driving diverts your attention from the road, causes you to be distracted in three different ways, and causes fatalities for you and others on the road.\\n\\nOne main thing that comes with driving is that you have to pay attention to the road and the people around you. You have to stay aware and alert to not only what you are doing but to what others are doing as well so you can correctly respond safely. However, if you pick up the cellphone for any reason makes it hard for you to do that if you divert your eyes from the road to your cell phone screen. Picking up that cell phone is not worth the disaster you could potentially cause.\\n\\nNext, using your cell phone while driving distracts you in three different ways: manual, cognitive, and visual. The cell phone distracts you manually when reaching for it to respond to that text message you got or to answer that phone call you're receiving; causing you to take on or more hands off the steering wheel. You're distracted cognitively when your mind is off the road. Cell Phones cause this when you're engaging in the conversation on the phone whether it's via text or call. Lastly, using your cell phone distracts you visually when you check that text message or that notification; causing you to take your eyes off the road. All of this are only three reasons why using your phone while driving is one of the most dangerous activities to participate in while driving.\\n\\nFurthermore, using your cellphone while driving causes many fatalities. The National Safety Council states that 1.6 million crashes are caused by the driver using their cellphone while driving. Statistics show that crashes caused by cellphones are six times more likely to happen than crashes caused by a drunk driver. In addition one out of four traffic crashes are spurred out of cellphone usage and each day 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving. All could've been prevented if they didn't pick up the phone.\\n\\nDue to reasons stated above, when you are in your vehicle driving on the road please refrain from picking up your cellular device. There are many ways you can stop yourself from getting distracted by your cell phone. All cellphones have a mute button which you can use every time you step in your car. There are some phones that have a do not disturb button that silences all notifications that are not emergencies. All this you could do to save the life of yourself and someone else.         \",\n",
       " \"Many people think texting and driving is a good idea because they think they can multitask. They believe they are above the law and won't get caught. But they don't understand the effects that is causes. There are other people who think texting and driving is a complete no go. I agree with the people who dislike it. There are many reasons why you shouldn't text and drive. To the punishment in the eyes of the law to death.\\n\\nA lot of individuals have lost their life due to using an electronic while operating a vehicle. In 2015 about 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving drivers whom were distracted. In a yearly basis there are 1.6 million car crashes involving texting and driving. It is also known it is 6 times more likely to cause an accident than a drunk driver. Noting the fact that being on a cellphone while driving equals to having a alcohol level of 0.8.\\n\\nThe justice system comes into this subject because of what punishment would the person receive. Tickets could range from $20 - $500, depending on the state. It could result into a misdemeanor charge. If there is a incident that eventually leads to injury or death to another driver, it could lead to jail/prison time. In Georgia if you are pulled over for this ticket start at $50. It will only increase by 50 each time. It could also lead to getting points on your license as well.\\n\\nBefore you get a ticket for texting and driving do these following things so you wont be temped to text or call someone. Put your phone out of reach. This will prevent you from grabbing it. Download apps that block incoming calls/text. With this app the only tie it will let you text or call back is when you are stopped and parked. If you need to use your phone for directions, invest in a cellphone dash mount. Following these simple things could save your life and possibly others.\\n\\nStopping texting and driving is a goal in todays generation. It is also known that texting and driving will never be eliminated. But hopefully a majority of people stop there will be a decrease of accidents. Hopefully the number of fatalities will also go down, causing less people being in jail for possibly injuring someone. By putting phones out of reach or by buying a dashboard mount.    \",\n",
       " \"PHONES & Driving\\n\\nDriving with a cell phone has its pros and cons but it really depends on the driver if driving with a phones is a bad thing. Some people use their cell phone for navigation that could help them get around in an unfamiliar area. The cons of it is that some people may be paying too much attention to their phone and not to the road. Being on your phone could be helpful or dangerous.\\n\\nThe reason it could be help full is that it would be easier to call for roadside assistances. If I were to have a break down I could call to have my car towed away and have a ride home. I also could use it to call for someone else who need roadside assistance and may not have access to it. It can also be used for traffic reports if there's heavy traffic or there's been a wreck and you can call for help.\\n\\nThe reason driving with a phone would be bad is that you could easily be distracted by it and can get in a wreck or cause one. Being on the phone with someone may cause you not to hear someone honking at you. Teens should not be able to have their phones in hand while driving since they use their phone the most.\\n\\nIf I were to make laws I would pass a law saying that people under the age of 21 shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving. I would make it cause usually the ones under 21 are the main one son social media the most and could even get distracted by a simple notification.           \",\n",
       " 'In today\\'s society everyone uses their cell phones everywhere and anytime. They have become the main source of our communication, entertainment and even education. People tend to use cell phones everywhere. Even when they are driving. The question is, should cellphones be used while operating a vehicle? My answer is no and this is why.\\n\\nCell phones have taken away from attention and respect. All persons cell phone etiquette varies. My grandmother only uses her cell phone when sitting at home similar to when she had a landline phone. On the other hand, my mother uses her cell phone all day and night and appears to be upset whenever her cell phone usage is interrupted. I find myself drifting away on my cell phone while in the middle of doing homework and even while cleaning.\\n\\nIn the article \"2019 texting and driving Statistics\" the US Department of Transportation reported that \"cell phone use while driving kills up to 3,000-6,000 people every year\" (Miller and Zois, 2019 ). This is because when checking your notifications which seems to only require a quick glance down at your phone, that is all the time it takes to cause an accident. I have personally experienced being in a vehicle with a distracted driver that was attempting to reply to a text message and slowly lost control of the car\\'s position in a lane. What if a car in the opposite lane was doing the same thing at the same time? We could have collided easily. Have you ever been driving just to be stopped at a light longer than the light is red? That would be compliments of another distracted driver in front of you and looking down at their phone instead of up at the light. Then there\\'s the distracted driver that missed the bike rider parallel to them simply because of taking their eyes off of the road briefly.\\n\\nThe thought of having your emails, social media and even a dictionary right in the palm of your hand has to be the best invention of the new millenium. With that being said, it causes us to adapt to checking those many notifications instantly. Even our parents are pleased with the ability to access their children at any time and any place. So much so that even my mother expects a speedy reply or answer, even during times of school or work. Car makers even started to incorporate cell phone usage during driving with the bluetooth features and auxiliary cords. Now rather than drivers texting, they have begun sifting through their various playlist and music apps rather than listening to the radio.\\n\\nLastly, we have the unpredictable emergencies that happen on the roads. If we are distracted by our cell phones, that causes a delay in our reaction to emergencies. I\\'ve often been driving myself and witnessed another driver having a tire blow out. If I was distracted by my phone, that would have prevented my quick thinking and ability to avoid the collision. I have also driven behind cars with missing brake lights. The only way I knew they were about to stop was because of my ability to visually scan my surroundings and to be aware of when the light changes or if I need to quickly switch lanes to avoid hitting them from behind. What about the recent incident of a tree collapsing on the highway? If everyone was distracted everyone\\'s ability to react would be compromised causing an even larger highway collision.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am anti-cell phone usage while driving. The bottom line is when you are driving the operation of that vehicle should be your only concern. Things can happen in an instance and you have to be fully alert to react, resist, or prevent from colliding with other cars. Texting and scrolling on social media can wait until you\\'re at your destination. Think of it this way, to use my phone while driving could mean life or death. If you ever thought about a friend you forgot to call back or a text to reply to it can wait. A prompt response is not worth your life or the lives of the people around you. Remember, states nationwide are turning into Hands Free states with a law that requires you to be free of any device while driving. If anything else, a reply is not worth the fine or the points on your license.\\n\\nWorks Cited: https://www. google. com/amp/s/www. millerandzois. com/amp/texting-driving-statistics. html               ',\n",
       " 'Its 11 am, and you\\'re driving to your favorite restaurant to get lunch, you decide to check your phone while driving to text your friend; as you\\'re typing your message, you run a red light and get side-swiped by another car. Texting while driving can lead to a potentially fatal series of events; not only for you, but for others around you.\\n\\nMany people think they should be safe if they only check their phones for a short period of time. This is negligent of the fact that a quick glance at their phone could be all it takes to get into an accident. If you\\'re driving on a highway, and decide to check your phone for a minute; the distance you would travel without looking at the road would be the length of up to 500 cars.\\n\\nImagine how many accidents you could get into if you consider the fact that people need to slow down, or change lanes.\\n\\nNot only does texting pose a danger, the constant thought of notifications, and texts that you might be alerted to can be dangerous. If you can\\'t focus on driving, and you keep getting notified of more and more texts or social media feed updates, you would be more convinced to check your phone. The safest thing to do would be to keep your phone on \"do not disturb\" or \"silent\". If you don\\'t think about your phone, the safer you will be as the temptation to use or check your phone would be diminished.\\n\\nNow you might be thinking, \"What if there\\'s an emergency, and I need to be contacted immediately?\". The safest thing to do would be to utilize what most cars come with, the ability to call someone without using your phone directly. In that case, instead of being texted, you could call, or be called. If you\\'re on a phone call, you can still keep your eyes on the road, and there\\'s less of a danger.\\n\\nDrivers should be allowed to keep their phones on them while driving, but be limited to only calling. You can easily call someone without taking your eyes off the road in most cases; if you have a car that can act as the medium to call someone.   ',\n",
       " 'It is illegal to text and drive. Some people think it is okay to text and drive. However, there also is a group of people who feel that texting and driving shouldn\\'t be allowed at all. Some people feel that if you know what you are doing that you should be able to text and drive. I personally feel as if texting and driving is okay. To an extent, some people should be allowed to text and drive.\\n\\nTo start off, I personally feel that texting and driving is okay. Part of me feeling that way is because I am a minor and always have my phone with me. Another reason why I feel that texting and driving is okay is because people make phones seem like they are the worst creation to exist when they actually have made positive impacts on societies. What if someone you care about is in an emergency? They could send you their location and you can go to help them.\\n\\nUsing your phone when you drive isn\\'t as bad as it seems. That is if you you\\'re mature enough to use your phone behind the wheel.\\n\\nWhat I mean by being mature behind the wheel is that you shouldn\\'t be texting on your phone is traffic is bad and stop signs are off. You shouldn\\'t text and drive when you\\'re\\n\\nGetting a text saying \"Are you going to the party on Friday?\" However, if you come up to a red light and you get an important text, that would be fine to text back. Another reason that texting and driving is okay is that if need directions somewhere you can have someone text you for directions. People today use their phones for a gps. Some people aren\\'t from the area they\\'re in so they need directions. Me personally I use my phone for a gps when driving in an area I\\'m not familiar with because im not going to get lost and wind up somewhere I shouldn\\'t be.\\n\\nAs good is texting and driving is for some people, it is also just as bad. Texting and driving can lead to car accidents. If you\\'re texting and looking down at the road and there\\'s someone reckless who runs their red light and crashes into you. Now your in an accident u probably could have avoided because you were looking at your phone. However, some gps apps help you avoid things ahead. Also if you feel as if someone is following you and you know your near a friend\\'s house, you can let them know your being followed and your coming to their house and they need to come out to make sure you\\'re okay. Texting and driving can help you avoid situations that you wouldn\\'t be able to avoid if you didn\\'t have a phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting a driving isn\\'t always a bad thing. You just have to know how to be responsible if you do it. You can\\'t text someone when a traffic light is off. Next thing you know you\\'ll end up getting hit.   ',\n",
       " 'PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Cell phones have not been around for a very long time; they have become a key part of our lives. So many people now days use their cell phone for just about everything such as: texting, talking, face time, and games. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nPeople these days rely heavily on cell phones to perform daily activities. Cell phone are used for phone calls, email, sending text messages, and performing other tasks.\\n\\nAs a result, an increase of accidents and fatalities have occurred because of the use of cellular phones while driving. It should be banned before more deaths calculate for something that can be avoided. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. A usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving. It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or of writing a simple text messages. No text is worth dying for.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phones should be banned while driving including text messaging, talking on the phone and use of electronic gadgets for cell phones. The consequences include the dangerous effect on health, financial stresses and injuries. Cell phones should be banned (except in emergency) while driving my personal suggestion would be that car manufacturing companies should install a cell phone signal jammer to avoid a serious accident in future.

       " 'Teen Driving\\n\\nWe all remember that teams are tied to their cell phones, which is why texting and driving is such a great fear. Most teenagers don\\'t find the real risk of texting while driving, as these texting and driving facts for teenagers can appear. Distracted driving is the hot-button subject matter, particularly when it comes to the younger generations. We get attached to our cell phone while behind this machine, but adolescent drivers are the worst offenders. This is a scary idea, as distracted driving is dangerous and harmful on its own. However add that with the ignorance of the teenage driver and we are talking about a real dangerous combination.\\n\\nTo start off, even though the risk of texting while driving are well-documented, that has done very little to stop adolescent drivers from doing so. Some people question why there are so many commercials about texting and driving. That is one of these numerous reasons. teenagers and even adults don\\'t consider how dangerous it actually is. The fact of the matter is that texting while driving takes the persons away from the road, severely increasing the chances of a crash. Moreover, teenagers that text while driving are proven to be out of this way within 10% of their overall driving period, as their thoughts are off the road and they aren\\'t paying attention to the direction of their vehicle.\\n\\nsecondly, the fact that teen drivers are usually the least skilled motorist on the road may make the information about texting while driving that much more difficult to tell, considering that most teens think that they are very skilled at what they are doing.\\n\\nsome states have attempted to enforce that texting while driving was bad among teens and adolescent drivers by establishing a particular band against the practice. Some states have still yet to give such a cell phone ban for inexperienced drivers. According to, Teensafeblog \"11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. Teen drivers are four times more likely than adults to get into car accidents while texting or talking on the cell phone. this shows how connected and attached we are to our cell phones no matter where we are at the risk that can take place. Some teams have even put on themselves that texting at a stoplight is okay because you are not moving and no one can be in danger. This is not true. You need to have just as much attention on the road when at a stop light as if you\\'re on the road moving. you need to be cautious of your surroundings and who is around you at all times, even when halted at a stoplight.

       " \"Phones have come a very long way since 1973, phones have gave us the power to communicate with someone miles far away. People fell more in love with them once the first touchscreen phone came out. Now people have to have one, all you see nowadays is people walking or driving with their phone glued to their eyes. Major companies come out with a new one every year and they come out with one that has better features, a bigger screen, and a new software.\\n\\nCars have been out for many years and car accidents have happened a lot in each year. Accidents due to phone usage leads to 1.6 million deaths and that should be lowered each year. More and more people still use their phones while driving but it's a bigger percent of adults who use them while operating a vehicle. The people driving think they can multitask but imagine just driving to the store down the street and you look at your phone for a quick second, but then when you look up all you see is your life flashing in front of you. I don't think driving and using a phone is eligible at any time because driving safely is better than taking a life.\\n\\nDrivers should be more cautious when driving because you never know if the person next to you is using the phone while driving. Georgia came out with a law this year where if you get caught with a phone while driving you will get a ticket. Georgia is starting to take more responsibility on the hands free law which is good because we are getting tired of hearing someone's son or daughter being ran over due to a driver not looking at the road when they need to. Adults who have been through that are probably in jail and some say they can't live with it on their conscious, they feel the pain they put the child's family through. They encourage people to please put the phone down while driving because they say it's not worth looking at a text and taking a life.\\n\\nThe rate of jail inmates keeps raising and in order to drop this number we as people have to encourage people to stop texting and driving. People feel bad about losing someone due to this situation but then go on the road while using the phone in an operating vehicle. Once reality hits them in that moment I think people would than start to make a change. Cars should have a sensor where if it detects that you are on the phone the car will automatically not cut on and won't let you drive until your phone is put up. If the car detects that you're on the phone while driving it will automatically pull over and cut off and won't cut on until you put it away.\\n\\nThat is my thoughts on driving and texting it shouldn't be allowed. Death numbers keep rising every year due to this situation and it should come to an end.            \",\n",

their daily tasks.\\n\\nCommutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.\\n\\nPeople spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nBut texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.\\n\\nJust in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nCell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.\\n\\nSome states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.\\n\\nWhen one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.\\n\\nWhen it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.\\n\\nThe first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.\\n\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.\\n\\nDuring 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).\\n\\nDistracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.\\n\\nVirginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).\\n\\nThe person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.\\n\\nIf the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it\\'s important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.\\n\\nJust in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).\\n\\nOver the total year, that\\'s nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.\\n\\nIf that\\'s not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.\\n\\nWith distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.\\n\\nWhen it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.\\n\\nNew drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.\\n\\nFor new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nAll of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.\\n\\n42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nMultitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).\\n\\nIf high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nThose under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).\\n\\nTeens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nEliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.\\n\\nIn terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.\\n\\nCell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).\\n\\nOver time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.\\n\\nUsing cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person\\'s life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.\\n\\nWithout constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone\\'s attention on the roads, someone\\'s brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone\\'s productivity.\\n\\nThis is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.\\n\\nWould it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?\\n\\nWhen it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.\\n\\nIf society does not take accountability for one\\'s deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there\\'s more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.\\n\\nPeople\\'s lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.\\n\\nAlas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.\\n\\nIt\\'s more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it\\'s about danger.\\n\\nIs it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one\\'s destination?\\n\\nThere\\'s advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don\\'t take it as seriously as it needs to be.\\n\\nIt\\'s not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.\\n\\nSo, it is up the

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A growing body of research shows that driving while using a cellphone can create dangerous distractions. However, many states do not have bans against the use of phones while none have forbidden the use of hands-free devices. Opponents of the idea claim that cellphone bans are difficult to enforce while others claim that drivers also engage in other distracting activities such as eating, listening to music, and arguing with their children. Nevertheless, a review of the statistics indicates that cell phone use, even hands-free increases the likelihood of fatal incidents which provides justification for the bans.\\n\\nHundreds of research studies across the world have highlighted the various risks of cell phone use among drivers. Having conversations on a phone while driving increases the likelihood of fatal incidents by 400% (Walsh et al. 1896). Therefore, cell phone use creates more risk than other distractions such as reading billboards or having conversations with passengers. A study sponsored by the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis concluded that use of phones while driving contributed to 6% of crashes (Delgado et al. 17). Texting and driving also present a significant problem especially among the younger generations. Research shows that drivers using mobile phones decrease their visual scans of the road, have a higher probability of weaving in their lanes on bends, and have slower reactions to hazards due to having one hand off the wheel.\\n\\nThe act of conversation itself also creates a distraction. While focusing on the road requires a certain amount of cognitive processing, the complexity of conversations also engages cognitive resources. MRIs indicate that during driving, people exhibit extensive stimulation in the parietal lobe of the brain mainly associated with spatial processing. However, when performing dual tasks, such as having a conversation, activity in the temporal lobes rises significantly signifying processing of auditory stimuli (Fitch et al. 712). The rise in temporal lobe activity corresponds to a large reduction in parietal-lobe activation which indicates that conversations require more attention which is diverted away from the driving task. If a driver chooses to prioritize a conversation, then it reduces their focus on the road, thereby increasing the likelihood of a crash. While some may argue that the use of hands-free devices reduces the risk of a crash, research provides contradictory results. A study on the cognitive effects of talking on cellphones concluded that while participants often crashed while chatting, drunk drivers had reduced likelihood of a crash (Lipovac et al. 136).\\n\\nCurrent legislation on cell phone use while driving is limited as legislators do not acknowledge the risks of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. Moreover, opponents of the motion claim that such laws are unenforceable due to the resources required to monitor all drivers. However, a review of a person\\'s billing records can determine whether they were using a phone while driving. Moreover, aggressive enforcement may also deter other drivers from risky activities.\\n\\nDespite the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, most states remain hesitant to implement appropriate bans. Statistics indicate that cell phone use accounts for a significant portion of car crashes due to the limited focus on the road. Bans would work to increase awareness of the dangers in addition to reducing fatal incidences.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDelgado, M. Kit, Kathryn J.

       " \"Phones and driving,The main meaning behind a phone is to have communication that's why it was created now the question is should we or should we not use our phones during driving. We need our phones for one thing and that's calling,Anything else other than calling could may or may not result in a crash or even death. Phones today are mostly used with teenager behind the wheel and there has been many accidents of teenagers using their phones while driving. Phones theses days cause many distractions while driving but that is their choice to pull out their phone while driving. So in my opinion i think we should have our phones while driving,so now let me explain why.\\n\\nPhones,Now a days we use phones for many other things other than calling. Our phones has been changing and still changing and adding more options other than communication such as apps. Apps are mobile applications that you can download on your phone. There are just so many things that we can do on our phones,we may wanna take a picture while we on the road or we may wanna watch a movie on our phone but like i said before we need our phones for many reasons and i'm not just speaking teenagers i'm speaking for everybody because now a days we live and run on our phones so only thing i can really say about texting or anything\\n\\nThat has to do with a phone in driving is stay safe.\\n\\nConclusion,in my opinion everyone doesn't need to have a phone while driving but no one is going to make a law saying we shouldn't have a phone while driving. It's just not gonna happen because it would not be a suitable law to create when everyone around the whole world has phones and use them while driving. We the people are just gonna have to be more careful when behind the wheel while driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Essay 2: phones and driving\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents and or get injured very badly because they use cell phones while driving. It is illegal in many states and it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive because these actions could lead to vehicle crashes. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nOne reason drivers should not use cellphones while texting and driving is because it is illegal in most states. If drivers are caught using their cellphones while driving they will be forced to pay a fine. Fines can cost from $20 to $250 dollars depending on different aspects. This fine is supposed to intimidate people when they use a cell phone while driving. People need to take caution of their surroundings so there are no wrecks; therefore, if you look down at your phone even for just a second a lot could happen which is why you need to be more alert while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason why not to use a cellphone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are much less dangerous. For example, the earpiece can be used to accept calls and to talk into this way you can keep both hands on the steering wheel. Do not have both earpieces in so you can listen out for other vehicles and your surrounding. Another hands free device is a car kit, if you do not have one in your car you can always buy one. Car kit is basically a touch screen radio and instead of texting you can voice your text to the carkit. It is okay to use your phone as long as your car is in p (park).\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should not use a cellphone while driving because it is illegal, it can lead to vehicle crashes. There are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you normally answer calls or texts when driving, stop and think about your life and other peoples life that you could put in danger before answering that phone call or text.            ',\n",
       " \"Texting While Whipping . .\\n\\nDriving a car doesn't take that much IQ but then you couldn't say that because why would there be so many crashes per minute. No, driving is hard if you're bad at concentrating on more than one thing. Driving is a whole nether set of skills and it's not as easy but then knowing that your bad at one thing collides with your crazy fast texting skills makes you comfortable doing something dumb like texting and driving. That doesn't really level out with your driving skills but not everyone knows that! But then your mom texts you while you're switching lanes on i85 then BAM! You find yourself playing bumper cars at 79mph barely ending it all! Driving while texting isn't good for everybody but it certainly ant for everyone!\\n\\nSome of these newer cars have addressed the fully automated phone utilizing Siri or even Alexa! This is probably one of the best things cars now days have to offer. Say you're driving and your mom text you, instead of playing bumper cars you could just tell your car what to reply back to mother! It's actual against the law not to have that feature in your car, not really but it should be. When you are doing your driving focusing is a level you have to raise the bar in and the more help you get on avoiding distractions the better.\\n\\nDriving while texting is very, dangerous, bad, stupid, fun, and life threating! Being fun because we like to get that rush of sending a whole paragraph while still not playing bumper cars with other drivers on the road. Getting that excitement that you were texting and driving and totally avoided a bad accident or even someone's specific instruction that told you texting and driving was bad gives some people a little additive rush! However, just because you got away with it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, who's to say you won't get away with it on Sunday?\\n\\nMore than 50% of car deaths comes from distractions and more than 50% of those distractions comes from cell phones. Cell phones are nice to have but not while driving. Driving should have a way for you to put your phone down in a slot just for you to start driving. It is very dangerous and you could be risking your life and others as well around you. Driving with your phone out isn't good but when your eye sight goes to your phone instead of the road there is almost always something bad on the verge.\\n\\nWhen on the road your attention has to be there as well! You have to understand that you're not the only one on the road and that individuals with families and kids that enjoy living want to keep living. When it's hard enough to concentrate on the road it gets 10 times harder to do so when having another screen in front of you. If you get caught with a phone in your hand while driving by and police officer they should react the same way as if your seatbelt were off! Safety and living will always come first. Phones are not needed at the wheel, your attention is!\\n\\n.   \",\n",
       " \"Driving & Phones\\n\\nFor a couple of years now a lot of people have been dying, getting hurt, and a lot of car crashes happen because of texting and driving. No one ever realizes what texting and driving can do to a person and anyone on the road. If there is one person on their phone around a bunch of other cars that puts everyone else in danger no matter what. The phones is what gets everyone killed on the road because it is such a distraction to people behind the wheel and they don't have the patience to get somewhere then check it. Phones are pretty much taking over a lot of peoples life's because they are so hooked to it.\\n\\nIn my personal opinion people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving or when operating any kind of vehicle. It puts the person using the phone and all of the other pedestrians around them. Every cell phone company should make all their phones have censors in them for when people start driving their vehicles and would make the phone unusable. The worst part is that people could carless about the other people about themselves. That's why there is so many deaths coming from crashes because there is always that one person that is on their phone and not looking where they're going.\\n\\nThe fact that everything is on your cell phone makes it worse because you receive a notification and you automatically have to check it. People nowadays do not have the patience to wait to get somewhere to answer the message or whatever they receive. Everyone is basically addicted to their phones which isn't a good thing at all because as technology gets better maybe it could fix the being on your phone while driving or it can make it worse. If cell phone companies were to find a way to put sensors in a phone and then when they sensor you using your phone it automatically locks it. That would put all of the drivers in a better environment because now they won't have to worry about getting hit by a driver that is too busy distracted on their phone.\\n\\nPutting sensors into phones won't be a bad idea but not everyone will buy the latest phone and getting drivers to not use their phone while driving will probably impossible. Companies can also change that if u get a notification it says it out loud so you won't have to pick your phone up. They could also make it to where you can only answer phone calls if someone wants to contact you instead of receiving text messages. Although they did pass a law where you get pulled over and given a ticket they are still not stopping texting and driving. There will still be those couple of people that still use their phones.\\n\\nBasically to sum everything into one paragraph I was talking about how texting and driving is so distracting and putting all of the people around them in danger. It is not safe at all to be using your phone while driving and even if you are at a stop at a red light you still shouldn't pull it out to check something on it. When getting a notification you should just wait until you get to your destination and then check and answer it. Even with saying all of that people still won't understand how many people they are putting in danger and only worry about them selves. Just don't text and drive and wait till you get somewhere to answer the text or whatever you received.       \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones are a part of everyone\\'s life in the twenty first century. Society uses them for everything from keeping up with social media, remaining in contact with people, personal entertainment and so much more. With so many people in possession of a cell phone, it is no surprise that they use them at inappropriate times. One of those times is while driving, the use of a cell phone while driving is not only dangerous but irresponsible. I think drivers should not use their phone while behind the wheel.\\n\\nDriving while on a cell phone is almost as bad as driving while under the influence. In the article LiveScience, it says; \"Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash,\" said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the NSC. \"Driving drunk is also dangerous and against the law. When our friends have been drinking, we take the car keys away. It\\'s time to take the cell phone away\". This shows that not only is driving while on the phone four times more dangerous than driving without a cell phone but it is also as dangerous as drunk driving. Cell phone use while driving is also common amongst teen drivers. According to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \"3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States\". This statistic shows that multitasking behind the wheel is dangerous and becoming a life-long risk. Knowing these statistics drivers should take more caution and families should take control of this risk.\\n\\nPeople might argue that they should have their own choice whether to use a cell phone while driving. In the article , Stop Texting and Driving \"Since each driver recognizes the potential dangers they could involve themselves with if they choose to text and drive, a law should not dictate a ban on texting and driving behind the wheel.\" This statement from the article shows that people think they should have their own choice if they want to text and drive and it shouldn\\'t be a law. Humans will always make mistakes while driving. In the the article FEE it says; Earlier government studies have repeatedly found other distractions to pose a far more serious problem than phone-related distraction. According to 2010 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, cell phone distraction has barely budged as a fatal crash factor, ranked behind drivers being \"lost in thought.\" This has not led to calls for nationwide prohibitions on daydreaming while driving\". In the year of 2010, cell phone use while driving wasn\\'t the most dangerous thing to do while driving.\\n\\nIn the article THE ZEBRA, texting while driving statistics from 2012-2018 say that \"14% of distracted driving deaths were attributed specifically to cell phone use, as opposed to other forms of distracted driving.\"\\n\\n1         ',\n",
       " \"Driving while texting is very dangerous for people on the roads. Millions of people have died from car accidents and texting while driving. I don't have driver license yet but I will be safe on the road when I get them . I have been in car accidents because other people were not paying attention and hit our car . I am glad they created the Hands-Free law to keep us safe .\\n\\nThe Hands-Free law was created to keep people from communicating while behind the wheel .

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nUsing a cell phone while operating a vehicle of any stature is a bad decision and should be illegal worldwide. Not only is using a cell phone while driving irresponsible, it's also dangerous to yourself, as well as others on the road. If one does choose to talk, text, or even try and use their cellular device while driving should be penalized to an extent and given a heavy warning. Though a warning, ticket, or even time served may be all it takes to prevent potentially fatal accidents on the road, these methods don't always work. Therefore we, as citizens, and as drivers, should be careful and wise with our decisions.\\n\\nReasons why driving and using your cell phone is so dangerous spans on and on. Firstly, one's not fully capable of providing one hundred percent of their attention to a single task such as driving while using their phone. Due to this, using your phone while driving only widens the window for a potential wreck, whether fatal or not. Studies show that using a cell phone and driving has become one of the top leading causes of car crashes in the past twenty years. Secondly, when one is distracted on the road, they put people in danger without even realizing it. There have been many instances where someone who is using their phone, ends up tailgating the vehicle ahead of them, with that vehicle potentially having an entire family in it. Many fatal crashes have been caused by this very action, injuring or even killing those involved in the wreck simply because someone wants to talk, text, or look at social media. So please, if you're driving, try and restrain from using your cell phone until you are parked in a secure location.\\n\\nNot only is there a wide range of dangers when using your phone and driving, there's also a long list of punishments that follow close behind. One of the main punishments for driving and using your phone is a fine. These fines can range anywhere from $150 to $500 or more depending on how many offenses you have. With such pricey fines, you'd think one would think twice before using their phone while operating a vehicle, but this isn't always the case. To counter this, those who repeat such actions can have their driver's license suspended for up to 90 days. Washington was the first to ban texting and driving state-wide with 38 other states following soon after. Some fines received in these states range from the minimum of $20 to a maximum of $10,000 and one year in prison. The average fine being around $150 to $375 in a handful of states. Insurance is another issue when it comes to using your phone while driving, with the coverage cost on your vehicle being affected. You see, the more of a risk you are on the road, the more you must pay on your insurance, so please drive safely.\\n\\nThose who aren't fond of dangerous drivers should know how to avoid them and stay out of harm's way. One smart and helpful way to steer clear of those pesky drivers is to alert authorities. If you can, it's smart to try and obtain enough information about the driver and their vehicle such as a description of the driver or license plate. Calling 911 can be what saves you or someone else on the road from a potential accident. Another good way to prevent potential accidents is to travel when traffic is at its lowest. Driving in the early hours of the day can be a good time to drive, as well as work hours just before the lunch-rush. One would want to limit the amount of traffic on the road as much as possible in order to decrease the possibility of encountering dangerous drivers. Lastly, one simply needs to stay on high alert when driving. It seems like a no-brainer, yet many tend to not follow this basic rule of driving. Pay attention to details such as the speed you and those around you are going. Conditions on the road are also important, such as rain, snow, and ice. Remember that simply paying attention to the smaller details can prevent accidents on the road.\\n\\nWhether or not you believe using your phone while operating a vehicle is as dangerous as it's portrayed to be, one cannot deny that it is a potential hazard. Many car crashes have occurred whilst using a phone and has become one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Not only is it dangerous, but it is also illegal in most states and one could also be fined a hefty amount. It's simply a bad idea to text, talk, and overall use your phone while driving. Many tend to put responsible drivers in danger through these acts and fail to realize it until it's too late. Remember to drive responsibly, paying attention to those around you and how you drive. Your phone is not worth a life.       \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers be able to operate a cell phone while driving? No, drivers should not use a cell phone while driving a moving vehicle. Its dangerous and very risky because you can be seriously hurt or be killed from anything once you take your eyes off the road.\\n\\nStatistics show that multitasking behind the wheel is life threatening.\\n\\nTalking, texting, or checking social media while driving takes the brain off the task of driving and can put you in a bad situation as an result. Its very dangerous for you and passengers in the car. Most importantly children if they are along with you inside the vehicle. Once your eyes are taken off the road , you're putting everyone's life in danger no matter the reason for why you took them off the road. If you take your eyes off the road for not even a second , then BOOM, you're flipped over inside your car and whoever is in the car with you is either dead or severely injured.\\n\\nUsing your mobile phone while driving can cause a number of bad things to happen. For example, a car crash. You could be changing a song on your phone and the out of nowhere a car pulls out in front of you going slow and you ram him or her in the back because you was on the phone while operating a moving vehicle. And when you and the other car make contact your car flips or the one you hit flips.\\n\\nAnybody can be hurt.. even by standers, that's why its important to focus on the task at hand which is driving.

       " '\"In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you.\" And that quote is by Sharon Heit, mother of texting and driving victim. This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn\\'t be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There is a lot of pros and cons, on if people should or shouldn\\'t be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle. As a teenager I see the good and the bad, but it doesn\\'t always means that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing.\\n\\nIn my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldn\\'t be allowed. Manly because there are more cons then there are pros. And if I was driving I wouldn\\'t be able to text anyone because I can\\'t multitask. And if I got into a car accident I wouldn\\'t be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone. And I\\'m the type of person that don\\'t like pain or going to the hospital.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t keep your attention on the road bad things can happen. Including put others life\\'s in danger, putting your life in danger, braking hearts of others and sometimes you\\'re on heart, going to court if the victim try\\'s to sue you. An example of putting other peoples life in danger, let\\'s say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied, and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happen that you can\\'t take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash. Taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well. And getting into a car crash isn\\'t always safe people can die on the scene and you couldn\\'t do anything about it, so that brakes others heart and possible yours.\\n\\nThe pros of cellphone used while driving: navigation, traffic reports, crime reporting, communication with a friend or a parents or if you have children. Now days, the cars have navigation in them. And if they don\\'t you can have cellphone holders for your phone. Communication with a friend or even a family member about something that\\'s going on, and you\\'re trying to get to where they are. And if you have children and you don\\'t know where they are and you\\'re trying to get a hold of them.\\n\\nThis essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn\\'t be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. And I don\\'t think people should drive and use there cell phone. There can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle. The exception can be about a death or a child, and of course navigation. And this is my opinion on if people should or shouldn\\'t be able to operate a vehicle while driving.          ',\n",
       " 'Technology has advance so much within the last couple of years. It is crazy how people have easy access to it and are eligible to communicate with each other very quickly. Cell phones are the main source of communication and to this day everyone can not seem to get their eyes off their phone. In many aspects it is good that everyone has a form of device to get around because they do come in handy. Although technology is highly beneficial and has changed the way certain things are being done, it is important that people use it when it is the correct time. A cell phone itself consist of many helpful applications but there are some moments where cell phones should not be in one\\'s hand and that is when they are driving.\\n\\nTexting while driving is very distracting because the driver does not have full focus on the road. Within this situation, the driver has a very high chance in getting themselves in a car accident. The amount of car accidents that are caused by texting and driving are enormous according to article, \"Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving\" (texting and driving statistics). It is better to see a problem and avoid it then to just continue to follow through. When people are texting and driving, they are clearly putting their own life at risk which is awful. When the driver takes their eyes off the road, they are most likely asking for something bad. Even then it is proven that texting and driving is worse than an intoxicated person driving, as proclaimed, \"One study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that texting while driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated\" (Steward law offices). People whom have a very easy temptation to touch their phone should not be driving just as those whom intoxicate themselves and then chose to drive. Ones life is at high risk and since this is a problem that is preventable, everyone should follow through because it endangers someone else\\'s life.\\n\\nWhen texting and driving not only is the life of the driver at risk, but also somebody else\\'s. Imagine losing someone or being injured just because one could not put their phone down. It is important to at least be considerate because the numbers of texting and driving have just been going up, as enhance, \"The United States Department of Transportation reported the cell phones are involved in a whopping 1.6 million auto crashes each year\" (Teen Safe).\\n\\nEnable for these numbers to go down, everyone needs to take put their phone down. As evidence shows, it is dangerous to be on your phone rather to be intoxicated which means being on your cell phone and driving should be banned all over the world. One may assume because drinking and driving is a crime so would be texting and driving, but in worst matters it is not. In the U.S there are some states that have acted, \"Currently, a patchwork of laws governs cell-phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 10 bans all use of hand-held cell phones, according to the NTSB\" (CNN). Although not all states have contributed to this law enforcement yet, some people should at least take this as advice. There could be countries that my not take this into consideration, but it is important that everyone does what is right so not everyone\\'s life is at risk. When driving the driver should withhold full focus on the road and not on their cellphone.\\n\\nCell phone use while driving sets a distraction for the driver. It enhances them to multitasks which is nearly impossible to keep full attention on both the road and cellphone. It is better to drive safe then to live a miserable life just because one decided to be on their cell phone. As human beings everyone has important things on their cell phone like maybe an important call or even then an emergency, but nobody\\'s life should be put in danger for something they did not do wrong. A lot of innocent people have had to be the victim in this situation. Before anyone even bothers to even start their car, it is important for them to take care of all their cell phone duty within that time period. If there is ever a moment that one may really need to use their cell phone it is better for them to pull themselves off to the side and take care of their problem because there is no need for this to become an innocent\\'s person problem. Although this may sound like a broken record this is an ongoing problem that can easily be avoided.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nAhlers, Mike M. \"NTSB Recommends Full Ban on Use of Cell Phones While Driving.\" CNN, Cable News Network, 14 Dec. 2011, www. cnn. com/2011/12/13/us/ntsb-cell-phone-ban/index. html.\\n\\nStewart Law Offices. \"Is Texting While Driving As Dangerous As Drunk Driving?\" Stewart Law Offices, Stewart Law Offices, 4 Jan. 2020, www. stewartlawoffices. net/is-texting-while-driving-as-dangerous-as-drunk-driving/.\\n\\nTeendriveadmin. \"Texting and Driving Crashes Facts and Statistics.\" TeenSafe, 19 Feb. 2019, teensafe. com/texting-and-driving-crashes-facts-and-statistics/.\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html.

I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.\\n\\nIts never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.\\n\\nShould a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature. I think everyone should just listen to the rules. Especially if you think about it, a law that could save your life or anyone else on the road. I think people shouldn't text and drive.               \",\n",
       " \"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.\\n\\nFirst is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all of the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minuets and just relax and drive. It can save a life\\n\\nNext is running red lights. Think about all of the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all of the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all of the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If your looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.\\n\\nLast is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. Your driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that about that before picking up your phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion all of these reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.      \",\n",
       " \"People do use their cell phones on a daily basis but they shouldn't use their phones when they are driving. When you are driving and texting you can cause a car crash or something worse. The only time you should have your phone while your driving is if you have a hands free mode. It is better to not text while driving you see some people like to text while they are driving so their not paying any attention to the road and to what's in front of them.\\n\\nThat will cause them to get into the following accidents: car crash, running someone over, or going off the road. These accidents have happened before including if there is a kid riding with you. It will also cause meager injures to the drive and the passengers even the kid. That is why we create cars that have a free hand mode so that way you call or text someone without looking at the phone. They even have phone holders that you can attach to the fane of your car.\\n\\nFor example I am a person who is always on my phone everyday. One day I am driving my kids to their friends house but then I get a text message from my friend. I pick up the phone and I read the text that means i'm paying more attention to my phone and not to the road. At that moment when I'm reapplying to his text suddenly a car pulls up and I try to slam on the brakes but then I crash into the car. I am very injured from the crash and my kids are also in pain that is what happens when you are texting and driving.\\n\\n99% of people have gotten into this kind of accident all because they were texting and driving at the sametime. If we all didn't have are phones when we are driving we could avoid these accidents and be safe. Even Some people who are texting and driving can even cause death to a person because they got ran over by a car. Phones are a distraction when you are driving because it claimed up to 3,450 live back in 2016 alone and it still is. It also caused 391,000 injured people in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.\\n\\nTeens are the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes when texting. Back in 2013 about 1.2 million of car crashes have occurred all because of cell phones usage while driving statistics that had shown that this kind of behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Texting while driving statistics show that doing this behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. That is why when people are behind the wheel they shouldn't have there phone when driving.   \",\n",
       " \"Since Alexander Graham Bell first patented the first practical telephone, the spreading of information has grown exponentially. The development of the telephone became something otherworldly. Today, people are able to communicate with each other at the tap of just one button. As amazing as that is, it has become an epidemic that people can't get themselves away from. More and more frequently the case of people getting into accident because of being on their cell phone while drive has been on the rise. This addiction has seemingly been the cause of many accidents that could have been avoided if people would have not been able to use their cell phones in any capacity while in control of a motor vehicle.\\n\\nTo begin with, cell phones and other electronics require attention from users that can't be given when operating a vehicle. Because of this, many people find themselves trying to split their attention between the phone and the road and typically end up giving more attention to the computer that they are able to hold in their hand. This lack of attention to the road causes accidents with other motorists which could have been avoided if there wasn't a phone in the way of the driver paying attention to the road. For this reason, people shouldn't even be able to use their devices in any such way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.\\n\\nMoreover, amny drivers have the mindset that their own personal driving isn't what they have to worry about--it's others. With a mindset like that, it begs the question of how that can be possible when motorists use their cellphones while driving. There is no way for anyone to be able to multitask so well that they can operate their vehicle, use their devices, and worry about others as they make it to their own destinations. Many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, but it has yet to be heard of someone multitasking at such a high caliber.\\n\\nFinally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what might happen in the blink of an eye. Drivers need to be fully aware of the roads and what happening around their vehicles, so there can be not time or effort that can be put into using their electronics in any way while also driving. If someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of an accident and casualties sharply increases.\\n\\nIn short, people should not have the ability to use their cellphones in any capacity while driving because the possibility of something tragic happen will sharply increase and the chance of someone surviving an accident because of cell phone usage will continue to drop.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nShould people be allowed to have a cell phone when driving is a no. I don't think that people should have one on them when driving. People already have a hard time staying off they phones without driving a car, they are already many cases of texting and driving, and lastly people who would be texting and driving would not just risk the lives of themselves but for other people as well.\\n\\nPeople already have a hard time staying off they phones without being on the road. Any noise or vibration that they phones makes people stop everything just to look to see what's on they phone. While on the road, people should put they phones on silent mode to stop them from being distracted when driving. They are also other free apps that people can download to help stop them from looking at they phones.\\n\\nThey are many of police reports about people getting into bad/life threatening accident. It is a proven fact that 11 teens each day from texting and driving. It's also a proven fact that 9 out of 10 accidents on the road are caused by people not paying attention to the road. People that are on they phones when driving are not only putting they lives at risk, they are putting the other people on the road, people in the car with them, and also putting who are walking down the road also.\\n\\nThe people how would be texting and driving are not just risking their lives, they are also risking other people around them. When are not paying attention to the road and the people around them they tend to more accidents. They are many causes of people not paying attention when driving and then hitting somebody else's car.\\n\\nThat's why being on your phone when driving isn't safe for people who already have a phone problem, the people who have already had accidents when driving should have learned the first time, and lastly when driving and on a phone puts a lot of other peoples lives at risk.                  \",\n",
       " 'Do you believe that drivers should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle?\\n\\n\"Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manages this dangerous risk.\" Cell phone distraction rates are at an all-time high. At the same time, drivers were less likely to be seen holding a cellphone or talking on a hand-held phone than in the prior survey.\\n\\nThe problem of distracted driving, especially cellphone use, continues to raise concerns. Texting and driving also appears to be a problem, especially among younger drivers. It is easy to understand why using a hand-held phone is a problem. In addition to having your eye on the road, with one hand on the wheel it is harder to navigate bends and respond to hazards. If the level of difficulty on the road demands a certain amount of driver concentration, but the state of the conversation also requires a depth of thought, then both activities will compete for a bounds amount of cognitive resources.\\n\\nThe use of a cell phone should not be allowed while operating a vehicle, I say this because distractions while behind the wheel has caused so much trouble. \"True Motion tracks five levels of distraction: Non-call active usage (texting and app usage); non-call passive usage (hands-free app usage); phone call in-hand; phone call hands-free; and no distraction.\" Naturalistic studies in the future may provide the means to document the patterns and circumstances of drivers\\' phone use and their effects on real-world driving. Currently, the best studies of crash risk used cell phone Company billing records to verify phone use by crash-involved drivers.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel. Do you believe that cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel? A number of jurisdictions in the United States and around the world have made it illegal for drivers to use hand-held phones. It appears that drivers\\' phone use will continue to increase, despite the growing evidence of the risk it creates. More effective countermeasures are needed but are not known at this time.   ',\n",

This shows that 2 years ago a lot of people were using cellphones while driving .I feel as if the government could have a system where they can detect phones while people are driving , which means officers can look in drivers cars and doesn\\'t have to be there physically. I think this idea will help people stay focused on the road more and can help other drivers stay safe.\\n\\nI also think people should not be able to use a cellphone in capacity while operating a vehicle because if you are focused on your phone and your at a stop , you can hold up traffic and you can get a ticket for holding up traffic. According to www. google. com \"a traffic ticket is $70 to $400 depending on your state law and or drivers records\\'.If you have a bad driver\\'s record and have unpaid tickets you will have to spend time in jail, pay fines, and your licences can get suspended.\\n\\nI was doing some research about texting and driving and according to www. google. com 49% american adults admit to texting and driving, and 90% of american adults know texting and driving is dangerous. Some people know how to drive and the consequences behind texting and driving and there are still car accidents pertaining a cell phone. With the technology today , there are still accidents that could have been prevented and that were involved with a cellphone.\\n\\nIn other words i feel as if drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving because people can get into accidents and get harmed or possibly die from it. I also feel like if people are on their phone while driving it distracts them and they can hold up traffic and and get traffic tickets .Last but not least , people know they shouldn\\'t text and drive and still do it . Society now and days know wrong from right but do the opposite .\\n\\nMy advice to people who text and drive ,is to stop texting and driving , if you need to use ur phone while on the road, make sure you have a passenger that can help with you.

       " \"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.\\n\\nSo the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nImagine if someone sends a text to a relative then they die because they were texting while driving. Texting while driving is a huge distraction can cause may accidents. A text is not more important than a life. Texting can wait once a person starts texting they are distracted from the road not only putting their own life at risk but others too. Texting and driving is bad it can ruin lives, its distracting, texting can also wait.\\n\\nTexting distracts from the road when someone's focus is on something else it makes doing the task more difficult. Causing accidents that may result in the loss of life for the driver or anyone affected. Distracted driving is looked down upon by other cars. Other drivers know there could be an accident involving them if there is someone texting and driving that may result in thel lose money and time possibly loss of time.\\n\\nResponding to a text while driving is not that important compared to the possible loss of life. This is why there are laws that prevent people from texting a driving which will result in a fin. Most people will probably choose living over texting because a human life is worth more than a response to someone's text. There are some people who have lost their life due to texting and driving. Now there familys are missing out of the time they could have spent with them if they were still living.\\n\\nTexting can wait, yes you may have to respond to a text but it is more important than a life. Iphones are now coming with a feature to prevent people from texting and driving, for example if they do have there phone in there hand they have to agree that they are not texting and driving before opening the phone up. There is also a feature that will auto respond to text messages saying that the person is currently driving and can not respond. The last feature is that they would not receive the notification until there not driving, that makes it easier to forget about responding so not to be pressured.\\n\\nTexting and driving is really bad and should not be done. Texting and driving is distracting and would cause you to have an accident. Responding to someone's text is not as important than someone's life. Finally responding to a text can wait and can be prevented because a life is worth more than a response to your friends and family.

A hands free law should be placed all over the world. A driver behind the wheel distracted, is like a vehicle driving by itself. Distracted driving seems not to be a great problem to people. People think that driving under the influence is worst, which is not the case. There are many effects due to distracted driving.\\n\\nDistracted driving is the number one problem that leads to many accidents. In many of those accidents, people die. \" In 2015, 37,461 lives were lost on US roads.\" It\\'s an increase of 5.6% from 2015. \" 10% of distracted driving led to crashes, 15% lead to injuries.\" \"The NSC estimated that cell phone use accounted 27% of 2015 car crashes.\" People that are driving districted is the same as if they were under the influence. When reading or sending a text message that takes your mind off the road for about five seconds, that\\'s long enough to cover a football field while driving at 55mph. Cellphone users are 5% more times likely to get into an accident than a undistracted driver.\\n\\nA worldwide law should be made for no cell phone use. Citizens should know longer be able to touch a phone when their driving. There should be no hands-free technology either. \"When finished making voice commands, drivers will stay distracted for up to 27 seconds. It takes 27 seconds for someone to get back into driving groove. Drivers might not notice signs, other vehicles, or pedestrians. According to the National Safety Council, almost 25% of car crashes involve cell phone conversations. Studies indicate that talking hands-free is more dangerous than drunk driving. Anything that can distract eyes, hands, or mind from the task of driving is considered a distraction. When someone is listening or speaking on a phone, their brain\\'s ability to process moving objects decreases up to 1/3. Drivers should stay off mobile devices altogether, until there safely parked.\\n\\nCell phone capacity should never be put up to debate. No driver should be allowed to use their cell phone or hands-free technology. Hands-free technology is three times as much danger as having a phone in hand. Hands-free and distracted driving is worse than driving under the influence. Thanks to a distracted driver fatal accidents occur. Accidents go up about 6% every year.

People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.\\n\\nThis issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.\\n\\nThese distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.\\n\\nThis issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.                                                           \",\n",

Through out the recent years,more than half the populations drive and text which causes them to highly get into an accident. Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions to yourself therefore the accidents may increase rapidly throughout the years. I would prefer doing it when you're driving just because it is safer than driving. Operating a cell phones while driving can lead you to crash and will get you to a penalty for it. The safe way that I would say is to keep your cell phones off when you are driving because you'll get distracted to the cell phones once you pick it up.\\n\\nThe increase of the cell phone uses are very high simply to social media. Some say that there is no wrong in the doing of the cell phones use but I think that it causes many accidents and death rates to increase rapidly. The actions that many people take are actually risking their lives over a notifications on the phone and that will go horribly wrong to those whom use cell phones while driving. We have to follow certain laws from accidents and causing them. Everyday,there's at least some of the people such as young adults who text and drive all the time. Risking your life for something that doesn't have greater impact of your life is basically saying that cell phones are more important than paying attention to what the real world has.\\n\\nDuring the years,many of the populations that causes theses accidents are young teens. Therefore,the death rate goes up throughout the years and some say that it's not the reason why. I feel like so many people look down into their phone then look up and see what's going on.

While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?\\n\\nCell phones have become a part of many people\\'s daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.\\n\\nUsing the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver\\'s awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. \"Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior.\" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)\\n\\nAn increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don\\'t realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.\\n\\nA large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it\\'s so important to have such strict rules and laws. \"Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver\\'s phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.\"(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)\\n\\nTo sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.            ',\n",
       " 'The Dangers of Using Cell phones While Driving\\n\\nWhile some see that there is no problem with texting and driving, there is a law that says otherwise. Texting and driving are not safe for any age citizens. Texting is a distraction from focusing on the road while driving. There is no multitasking when it comes to texting and driving. There have been too many car accidents that have been caused by people using their phones while driving. To reduce the number of deaths due to texting and driving cell phones should not be permitted by drivers in any capacity.\\n\\nGeorgia\\'s Hands-Free Law came into effect on July 1, 2018. ( \"Georgia Department Of Driver Services, \" 2018). This law states describes that it is illegal for drivers to hold their cell phones while driving. Drivers are allowed to use GPS, voice to text features, and receive and make calls hands free. Earphones are the best to use in this case; however, a person can only use one earpiece at a time. This law will help to reduce the number of many accidents caused by distracted drivers from cell phones.\\n\\nIn general, citizens should not use a cell phone while driving. Being on the phone while driving increases the risk of crashing. Even if you are stopped at a red traffic light, it is illegal and not safe. If there is an accident for texting and driving, there are penalties. The penalties are based on the first, second, and third offense. At each offense, there is a monetary fee and points taken off of your driver\\'s license. If a driver has too many offenses, this could result in the suspension of an individual\\'s license.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is one thing that people cannot multitask in, and that is texting and driving. When drivers text their attention is divided when it should be focused only on the road. Texting and driving is a dangerous thing because you can injure or kill someone else or even yourself. When driving you not only have to be focused on the road but also you have to be considerate of others on the road.\\n\\nAfter all, texting and driving is against the law and just is not safe. No matter how young or old you are, you cannot focus on driving and texting without being at risk of having an accident. To protect your own life and others do not use your phone while driving. If you want to use your phone, you should wait until parked off the road. That way, you will not get any tickets, nor will anyone\\'s life will be at risk.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nGeorgia Department Of Driver Services, dds. georgia. gov/.            ',\n",
       " 'Phones have evolved exponentially, especially from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. Over the course of ten years, phones without cords have become commonplace. Many individuals use them while shopping, cooking, and exercising. There also use them while operating a vehicle. However, using any device while driving can cost thousands of dollars and even your life. Cellphones should not be used while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nThe term distracted driving has become prevalent in courtrooms because drivers are more susceptible to the accessibility cellular devices, streaming services, and social networks provide. According to the auto insurance comparison search engine, The Zebra, approximately nine people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured from car accidents when one driver is preoccupied with their cell phone. This means that defensive drivers are not impervious on the road when another driver utilizes a cellular device. We, as a society, have the responsibility to keep others safe. The next time one sees their loved ones should not be on an autopsy table following an easily preventable car accident. The solution is to this dilemma is to enforce laws pertaining to cell phone usage and operators of vehicles.\\n\\nNew drivers already face the challenge of utilizing their defensive driving in their daily lives. Many drivers, both new and experienced, would say that a notification on their phone takes a second to acknowledge. However, those who check messages risk their lives. According to Miller&Zois Limited Liabilities Company, a law firm based in Maryland, five seconds of viewing a text message is the amount of time it takes for car travelling at fifty-five miles per hour to drive across an entire football field. Therefore, if an individual decides to look at a notification or respond to a text message, that person could enter a river or cliff at that same speed by using a phone while driving.\\n\\nCitizens are not entirely at fault. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving is under-reported by law enforcement. This, in turn, means that too many offenders are only given warnings and no punishment for their reckless behavior. Tax-paying civilians are suffering because authorities do not hold offenders accountable for dangerous driving habits. Every state must outlaw phone use and produce punishments for those who continue to indulge in their distraction on the road, lest they seek for a steady increase in distracted driving injuries and fatalities.\\n\\nHumans are said to be social creatures. However, social behaviors will limit the focus of drivers. A single second is an ample amount of time to lose one\\'s life. Phones and driving are as compatible as water and oil. Do not post a picture, send a text message, read a book, or watch a movie when behind the wheel. Put the phone out of sight and out of reach.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Distracted Driving Statistics.\" The Zebra, 09 Apr 2019.

       " 'I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because it causes many car crashes every year, it can make your car insurance go up even higher, and if you have a passenger in the car you should also think about their lives as well. People are more worried about who they\\'re texting or who they\\'re on the phone with. Driving while on the phone shouldn\\'t be taken lightly because you are endangering your life and others around you. In this essay I will give you reasons why texting on the phone should be banned.\\n\\nThe first reason is that you can easily cause an accident while you\\'re on the road. If you use a phone while driving it\\'s basically like you\\'re driving while drunk because you\\'re not focused on the road as much as you think. \"Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving\". If you are texting while driving you\\'re going to be more focused about sending that text to your friends or family than driving. \"One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving\". That is the first reason why you shouldn\\'t text and drive.\\n\\nAnother reason while texting while driving should be banned is because it can cause your insurance to go up. If you get in a car accident because you were texting instead of focusing on the road is bad because your insurance company will find out and they will raise your car insurance because of that. \"The more tickets you attract to your name because of driving while on the phone the more your insurance bill goes up\". If you cause an accident because you were on your phone then the bill to get there car fixed has to be paid by your insurance company. \"It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use their insurance company has to pay for the damage\". That is my second reason to why cell phones should be banned while driving.\\n\\nMy last reason why cell phones should be banned is because they could hurt or even kill passengers or pedestrians. Transporting other people in your vehicle is a big responsibility especially if you tend to use your phone will driving. \"Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, even though some young drivers fail to notice\". If you use your phone to send a text while driving with passengers in the car you are putting their lives in danger as well as other pedestrians. Most people probably couldn\\'t live with the guilt knowing they caused someone to suffer a life altering injury or even death. \"Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle\".\\n\\nThat is the last reason why I chose to ban cell phone use while driving.\\n\\nLaws banning texting and driving should be mandatory in each state. Many people do not realize that texting while driving can be just as dangerous as driving drunk. People should always be focused on the road then texting someone while driving especially if you just started driving. Those are my three reasons why cell phone use should be banned while driving.\\n\\nShould cellphone use be banned while driving?         ',\n",
       " \"Cellphones & Driving\\n\\nMore and more people are finding access to cell phones as technology develops and becomes more inexpensive. Cars are starting to become more technologically advanced as well. With the ever evolving future of technology people are making questionable choices such as time and place of use. More and more people have began using their electronic devices as they drive putting not only themselves but the lives of others in danger. Cellphones should not be used while operating machinery such as a car or truck or SUV.\\n\\nBehind the wheel is no place of use for cellphones. You're putting yourself in severe jeopardy of being hurt or killed. When driving you should always have your attention on the road as to avoid any bad situation or at least help prevent one. Cell phones distract you from this goal and may cause you to get side tracked. Without the use of phones behind the wheel there's less likely a chance that you will get into a wreck.\\n\\nA lot of cars are becoming more technologically advanced as science progresses. We now have self driving cars which can keep the driver hands free. These self driving cars may still have trouble reacting to split second decisions in which May cause you harm. Even if you don't have to drive yourself you should still be focused on the road. A cell phone may be more appropriate in this situation given that you're not the one driving the car at the time however to ensure safety do not use your phone until the vehicle is safely parked and there is no risk of a wreck.\\n\\nBluetooth technology has been changing the way we use electronic devices for years. With this there is no reason to constantly be in use of your phone when the Bluetooth streams the audio directly from the device to your cats radio. People have created mount devices for phone in cars to help keep you off them more but still do miniscule tasks that you may deem necessary. Many people put their phone in the back seat just to keep it out of arms reach and dampen the temptation of usage.\\n\\nUltimately cellphones in cars are a bad idea. Drivers still need to pay attention to the road rather than to a device that's endangering their lives. Despite all of the advances in technology there's not a single one which ensures complete safety. The use of Bluetooth and other strategies to help limit cellphone usage may help if a drive is in need of a prevention plan for cell phone usage while driving. Don't endanger yourself or others by not operating a motorized vehicle with a cellphone in use.      \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nLives of loved ones are lost each day. There are many possible events that can contribute to one\\'s death, and distracted driving is too often one of these causes. Phones are used for communication and benefit our lifestyle, but they have also become a major issue while driving. Although, many people know that there are severe consequences to being a distracted driver, they still do it. Driving is a big responsibility and it should be taking very serious. Texting is the main reason as to why people check their phones in the first place, and it keeps getting worse.\\n\\nMany companies and programs have encouraged people to drive as safe as possible. Many fail to perceive that teens are the largest group involved in car accidents. Teenagers involved in a car accident make careless mistakes like using their phones, and endanger their life. People don\\'t comprehend that using cellular devices while driving is taking very serious by the law. It is a crime and will have serious consequences held against you. The use of cell phones should not be allowed while driving.\\n\\nThe consequences of texting and driving can be fatal. Many believe that texting and driving isn\\'t a big problem and that they are able to handle multitasking. According to Snyder and Associates, atleast 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phone while being behind the wheel. It is very tempting to answer a text or a call while driving, but you should be aware of all the safety risks that come with making that decision. Most states have passed laws to make texting and driving illegal. Although most of the US has made an effort to persuade people to drive safely and avoid texting while driving, The National Safety Council reported that approximately 1.6 million car crashes are due to the use of cell phones. Lives of many are lost prematurely because of drivers who make the wrong decision and choose to text and drive. How many more lives have to be lost in order for people to understand that a text can wait?\\n\\nTeenagers are the main and largest group that are implicated in consequential car accidents. According to the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, distractions are one of the main \"critical errors\" that lead to teens crashing. Teenagers who are new to driving don\\'t have as much knowledge as an experienced driver. Taking their eyes off the road and checking their phones is a common and dangerous mistake that many make. Most adolescents know the consequences of being distracted while driving. As reported by Edgar Snyder and Associates, 56% of teen drivers admit to talking on the phone while driving, and 13% admitted to texting and driving. Being behind the wheel is a big responsibility. The driver not only has to think about being safe they have to think about avoiding any fatal injuries to themselves and/or others.\\n\\nNo state completely bans the use of cell phones for everyone completely. According to\\n\\nGovernors Highway Safety Association, 38 states ban the use of cell phones for teen drivers, and 21 states as well as D.C. prohibit cell phone use for bus drivers completely. Utilizing phones behind the wheel has serious a serious outcome. Premature death is one of the many results of drivers being distracted. There are consequences for those who break any type of law, and breaking driving laws is not an exception. Traffic citations, fines, loss of license, and/or jail are a few of the many consequences. Fines and jail time may increase if the incident keeps happening, if the driver is drunk, or if the driver or any other passenger is injured.\\n\\nThe person behind the wheel is accountable for getting to places safe. Driving is a big responsibility and should be taken extremely serious. Drivers need to understand that to get to a destination it is a must for you to follow the safety rules. Distracting driving is something that can be changed. There is no need for people to die and their families to suffer, because a person is driving carelessly. Be responsible.   ',\n",

       " \"In The United States of America and throughout the whole world the usage of cars has been in existence for so many years. Humans use this vehicle to get from one place to another in a easier way. Cars have not always been a safe spot to be in. Many human beings have lost their lives because of a car accident. Technology and social media has had a big growth throughout the years and it has played a major part in car accidents. Phones should not be used while driving.\\n\\nThe first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you have a higher chance of getting in a car accident. Getting in a car accident is bad because you are able to lose your life or even worse, killing someone else. If you were to die in a car accident you would definitely leave your family destroyed. Imagine your mother and father having to bury you instead of the opposite way around. It's most likely that you will always live with the fault that you killed someone else. Putting the phone on the side and on do not disturb is something so easy to do than can benefit you in the long run.\\n\\nThe second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you can get yourself a ticket. You might not think that it's a big deal but it really is. A ticket can cost you a lot of money and sometimes trouble. A ticket can cost you more than what you would pay for your phone bill. Having a ticket means having a bad record. For any reason when you want to get a new job, They will be able to tell that you aren't a responsible driver and even worse not a responsible person. It's better to have a good record than to not have one and not be able to get the job you want.\\n\\nThe third reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because phones can be put on do not disturb. When your phone is on do not disturb you are not capable of receiving calls, text messages, and notifications from any of your social media accounts. You have to be able to control your brain and body. Your phone is not a need, It's not something you have to be holding every second/minute. Allowing your phone to be on do not disturb is allowing you to live a longer life and prevent a tragedy like a car accident. It's better to think soon than regretting it later when it's too late.\\n\\nA phone should not be allowed to be used while driving because you can kill yourself or kill someone else, you can get yourself a ticket, and phones can be put on do not disturb. It's nothing new to watch the news and see that there's another victim of a car accident due to phones. People have to think better and make smart decisions on the road. Once you have your hands on the wheel you shouldn't take your eyes off the road. Accidents due to being on your phone can cause you stress in life and also capable of having bad memories. Prevent is better than to regret and that will be the smartest quote to remember in life. Keep your eyes on the road and don't let a phone distract you.   \",\n",

On the contrary phones may be a distraction when a driver is behind the wheel. When someone is driving they should be aware of their surroundings at that point in time.\\n\\nReasonably, people need to set their phones aside while they are operating a vehicle. The chances of an accident are increased when the driver has a phone in hand. Your eyes must remain on the road and with the hands on use of a cellphone, it is not possible. Drivers need to practice safe driving and be attentive behind the wheel. Safety always comes first, especially on the road.\\n\\nCountless car accidents have happened because a driver was more into their phone rather than what was happening on the road. Once you realize you may crash the vehicle when you look up from your phone it is often too late. If a driver puts their phone down when they are behind the wheel, they will be more attentive. An aware driver has a significantly lower chance of an accident in comparison to an unaware driver.\\n\\nTo summarize each point given, driving while using a cellular device can be very dangerous. The phone becomes a hazard to the driver and everyone else on the road. In order to correctly demonstrate safe driving, the phone must be set aside while a driver is operating a vehicle.   ',\n",

It's only fair to the community that a no cell phone policy should be passed because innocent citizens are dying. Car accidents are not just tied around phones because most accidents are people under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the United Sates.

I bet you didn't know that 26 percent of accidents are caused by people who were using their cell phones while driving.

It doesn't matter if it took you two seconds or two minuets to text something back; the point is your focus wasn't on the road, and because of that you are now in another lane. One example of this is actually one that happened to my family and I while we were on a trip. The car in front of us kept going off the side of the road, and kept swerving in between the two lanes. When we finally got over and got around him, we saw where he was distracted by his phone. When you get distracted and start swerving, you are putting the people around you in danger, which is my next topic.\\n\\nWhen you are driving and you are paying attention to your phone rather than the road, you are putting the people around you in danger. An example of this would be something like; say you're driving, and there is a wreak ahead and the car in front of you stops. However you had no idea that they had stopped because you were too busy looking at your phone. Say you don't stop in time and you hit them. Or say you slam on your breaks at the last second so the person behind you, hits you. What if you can't stop in time so you have to swerve over. In any of these situations you have put someone else, and yourself in danger. Plus on top of that you could have caused an accident. That takes us along to my next topic, accidents.\\n\\nAccident can happen anywhere at anytime, and can be caused by anyone doing anything. But like I said before 26 percent of accident are caused by drivers on their phones. I'm sure everyone has heard their own story about an accident that has happened because someone was on their phone. However one that really just sticks out to me is one my family and I saw the aftermath of. We were driving up to Atlants on weekend. There wasn't much traffic on either side of the interstate, it just looked as it usually does with Atlanta traffic starting to kick in. A little further down the interstate on the other side there was a ton of traffic. We looked as we went by all the fire trucks and police cars, and there was an 18-wheeler and a smaller car. The smaller car was up under the front of the 18-wheeler. Later that night my parents had the news on and it said that the driver of the 18-wheeler was on their phone and had gotten distracted. They wern't paying attention to the road or what was in front of them and somehow ran over the other smaller car.\\n\\nTwenty-six percent of accidents are caused by distracted drivers on their phones. Being distracted by your phone while driving can cause swerving, putting others in danger, and accidents. If you are swerving while you're driving, you are putting the people around you in danger, and that could lead to an accident. This is why I do not believe cell phones should be allowed while driving. So next time that you're behind the wheel, think before you pick up your phone. You don't want to be part of that 26 percent because you couldn't wait to open your friends Snapchat.         \",\n",

We keep our phones closer than our loved ones. Phones are a constant distraction such as meetings, movies ,meals and especially when we are driving. Everyday people die from car accidents because someone was using their phone while driving . Studies have shown that there is a 4% greater risk of drivers being in a car accident due to using a cell phone.

You are focused on the road but if something happens to your phone for example the call ended or you received a message then you are distracted and want to grab your phone .

But that's not true a car accident can happen based on the driver not looking on the road . You can't multitask when you are driving ! If you would like to be a safe driver you would have to make sure you process a ton of information about your environment and surroundings at all times.\\n\\nGeorgia's new hands free cell phone law has resulted in more than 1,000 tickets since the start of the law . Georgia's residents aren't allowed to have their phone in their hand or part of their body . They are only allowed to use if it's on a wireless headphones, speaker or bluetooth . Their first fine is $50 , second is $100, and third is $150 and a subsequent conviction . Georgia has become the 16th state that enacted a hands free driving law. Georgia would like for residents to stop using their devices when driving because cell phones only continue to increase the number of accidents.\\n\\nIt's a privilege to be able to drive and we shouldn't just think about ourselves but about the people we are risking when we are driving. Cell phones are a very important tool in our life but we should know when it's not the right time to use it.

Humans also use cellphone while driving drivers should not drive while texting or talking on the phone. It to dangerous in the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.\\n\\nDrivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash.\\n\\nSome states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. But there a good system call \"handsfree\" an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands).

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe usage of cell phones instantly grew after the introduction in the 1980s. One of the primary reasons they have grown in popularity is cell phones allow people to communicate from all over in a matter of seconds. Due to the fact cell phones are such a vital part of lives, phone use while driving has become a definite safety concern. Adults spend an average of 45 minutes a dav on social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted 1,830 motor vehicle accident fatalities for young drivers, according to teendriversource. org. Many of the accidents were from distracted cell phone use. Cell phones should not be used in any capacity while operating a car for fear of distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities.\\n\\nCell phones being such an essential item in today\\'s society, people find it hard to let go of cell phones while diving. Phone holders and Wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. Participating in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, creates distractions. Texdng, calling, reading tex ts, or sin1ply holding a phone to your ear can cause a momentary attention distraction. In a split second these distractions can cause a major accident. Phone usage is so dangerous because drivers are distracted with manual operation, visual reading, and cognitive processing (Bonner).\\n\\nAccidents are financially costly to all parties involved. Car insurance can double when accidents are caused by phone usage. For drivers at fault in accidents, rates increased more than\\n\\n$500 (Moore). The number of accidents determine car insurance rates for the area. With more accidents due to cell phones, rates have increased overall. All drivers are paying in some way for the irresponsibility of distracted drivers. Many states have passed laws to prohibit cell phone use while operating a car.\\n\\nUsing a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S roads. In the U.S., inappropriate phone use caused over one million car accidents (Edgar Snyder, n. a). Teen accidents with motor vehicle crashes involving fatalities were a result of distracted driving. When answering a text while driving, it takes your attention away for about five seconds. A great deal of things can happen in five seconds. Overcorrecting the car while on the phone has unfortunately been the cause of many fatalities. No conversation is worth human life\\n\\nIt goes without saying that cell phone use in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and threatens safety. Statistics support the reasoning for restriction of use while operating a motor vehicle. Distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be forbidden.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nBonner, Marianne. \"Cell Phones and Other Driver Distractions.\"\\n\\nwww. thebalancesmb. com/cell-phones -and-other-driver-distractions-46 2423.\\n\\nUpdated April 4, 2019.\\n\\nChildren\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute. \"Teen Driver Statistics.\"\\n\\nwww. teendri versource. org/teen-crash-risks-preven tionlcar-acciden t-preventi onlbasic- facts\\xad about-teen-crashes.\\n\\nEdgar Snyder and Associates. \"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics.\"\\n\\nwww. edgarsnyd er. com/car-a ccidentlca use-of-accidenticel1-phone/ce ll-phone-statistics. html.\\n\\nMoore, Ben. \"How Much Car Insurance Rates Go Up After an Accident.\" www. nerdwallet. com/blog/insurance/how-much-car-insurance-quotes-rise-after-an\\xad accident-or-vio lation/.

       " 'Cell Phone usage in cars\\n\\nDo you ever catch yourself being on your phone more than you should be while driving down the road? In today\\'s world we have had to put a lot of laws and regulations in place just to keep people safe. For example Georgia\\'s hands-free law took effect July 1, 2018 with all new rules and regulations about cell phones being used while driving.\\n\\nIn my opinion parts of the law makes things safer but then some of it is a little too much. One thing that I agree with is that \"Even with hands-free technology, drivers cannot write, read, or send text messages, emails, social media content and other internet data while on the road.\" I feel very strongly about this one due to there being so many people who have accidents while trying to send texts or look at the latest posts while at a traffic stop. Some parts are a little too much though, starting with \"Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while driving. \"It would be crazy to get a ticket just for your phone touching you.\\n\\nPhone usage in vehicles has its pros and cons. I think it\\'s great to have a cell phone with you at all times any time you get in a vehicle to drive in case of an emergency. Also Cell phone usage usually causes emergencies. I believe drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle, but only hands free. Also they need to make the vehicles more acquitted to ensure cell phones can only do certain things in it.\\n\\nFor example care could not allow any texts to be sent or received. You also shouldn\\'t be able to make hands free cells when going certain speeds. I also think they should bult in systems for teenage drivers where it sends notifications to the parents when they go over the speed limit, break hard or drive without a seat belt.\\n\\nIn conclusion I feel that cell phone usage in vehicles should be allowed. They create a lot of accidents but they also save lives by calling for help. Cell phones are a lot of people\\'s lifelines. And should be allowed usage in cars!\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Governor\\'s Office Of Highway Safety In Georgia.\" Highway Safety Laws in Georgia | Georgia Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety, gahighwaysafety. org/highway-safety/.

It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cellphones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.\\n\\nCell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues in today's society. People are using their cellphones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or being on social media. Sometimes we can do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are using their cellphones while they are driving. We have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others and ourselves because we cannot put the phone down.\\n\\nUsing cellphone while driving is not a good idea because it can hurt others/yourself, the roads, rise your insurance, or even have to come out your pocket to pay for the damage you have created to someone else car.\\n\\nTexting while driving and otter cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threating norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phones use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\\n\\nAn alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including the use of mobile device while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life .\\n\\nTherefore, if you have an emergency you may use a cell phone to dial 911 o you can also pull over. When you have an emergency you have the right to dial the police if something is not right.\\n\\nIn my opinion people use that right to get on social media, check messages, or call someone instead of just continue to drive and keep their eyes on the road.\\n\\nIn my opinion you should not use cell phones while driving because it can cause crashes, death, or even hurt the road.\\n\\nIf it's not an emergency you should not be able to use your mobile device.            \",\n",
       " 'Current day, almost everyone owns a cell phone. When using a cell phone, you are easily distracted. For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you\\'re easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you\\'d be in a car. There\\'s a right time for your phone, the car is not one.\\n\\nWhen you\\'re driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it\\'s hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you\\'re driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the \"Hands Free\" rule to where it\\'s illegal to be on your phone as you\\'re driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I\\'ve ever heard of.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn\\'t be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or \"Important Phone Calls\". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn\\'t have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that\\'ll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn\\'t be a law.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It\\'s not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There\\'s a right time for your phone, the car is not one.   ',\n",
       " \"Driving and cell phones are like water and oil they do not mix. The generations of today does not understand that when it comes to texting while driving, it is a highly dangerous thing that turns into a horrible habit. Yet it still persists to be a problem. They do not see the danger, the risk of punishment, and the effect it can have on their normal lives.\\n\\nMany cannot see the consequences driving and texting can bring to their lives and the life changing effects if others are affected.\\n\\nFirst of all, the dangers of this habit is that people have started to make are hugely deadly to everyone who participates in it. Texting while driving has an equal to more deadly affect on you as drinking and driving. The main reason is that it is a distraction, when a person checks their phone or device they take their eyes off the road.\\n\\nThis can cause massive accidents and deaths across the entirety of the united states. Our new generation is at greater risk, most times it is within the youth that is the age of twenty and below causing car insurance to become more expensive for the youth.\\n\\nSecondly, if a person is caught they are subjected to a ticket, first offense for 50 dollars and second offense 100 dollars including points on their drivers licenses depending on the state.\\n\\nA person can not get jail time for texting and driving, but can be sent to jail if texting while driving is what caused an individual to crash and kill a person. Most times however people will sue for the damages caused to them and their personal vehicle. These are the possible ways that people can get in trouble for texting and driving.\\n\\nLastly, the effect it can have on a person's life can be very drastic. As I mentioned with the ticket one can receive it will most times raise the prices of the insurance provider that the person may have and cause an increase in price. Another effect that it can have on a person's life is jail time, which on its own is bad as it takes away some rights like the inability to vote, own a firearm, or sometimes get a job. Due to one decision, it can change a person's life forever, especially if their actions take away a life. That is some examples of major ways this can affect a person's life.\\n\\nThus I end with the evident conclusion that the entirety of the texting while driving problem is exactly as I stated a problem that must be dealt with. The portable devices and dangerous habits need to end on account that it kills thousands on the roads every year. With the laws and regulations in place along with the law enforcement watching this problem should clean itself out. The problems of the danger involved, the risk of punishment and impact on regular life should make all people reconsider before picking up the phone while on the open road.   \",\n",

Most safe drivers die or become injured from other drivers that are not paying attention.\\n\\nThere are people who actually follow the rules of the road that die from other drivers. When other drivers are doing what they are supposed to do but another driver isn't then both their likes are at stake. Not every driver breaks the rules, a lot of ppl like to keep themselves safe and keep others safe.\\n\\nFinally new drivers will be affected by this as well. Newer drivers might be scared to get on the road bc of other drivers.\\n\\nMost young drivers use their phone while driving as well. Teens today are all about technology which causes them to use their phone while driving. Tere should be more of a penalty if you use a phone while driving. It will slow down how many people get into car related accidents. With this in place then everyone will be so much safer while driving.\\n\\nThis is why no one should drive with a phone. It kills people and affects their lives. Something should happen if someone is caught with a phone while driving. Teens should be taught not to use phones when they are learning to drive.                                          \",\n",

Honestly doing any like that can lead to no common sense especially when you have someone in the car with you. Over thousands of people die from a car accident situation which unlikely happy for love one's. I feel like more of this comes from young adults and teens because there still in that developing stage where this and that needs to be learned. Even though, car accidents happen you shouldn't be scared to drive or stop you from driving.\\n\\nYou should just be a lot safer than other with driving. But, if you happen to get a crash and it manage to be your fault you shouldn't take it all into that one mistake to.\\n\\nThere are a lot of things you need to realize with driving and texting. First of all if you do it you need to be cautious and smart about it. Because one if you need to text someone because it's an emergency do it at a red light or if you need to tell someone important then just stop somewhere . If you don't do none of the sort you can lead to accident or dealing with the cops. And, you can get in a lot of trouble with dealing with the cops. If you feel like driving and texting is ok then maybe it is to you only if you know what your doing and being safe with those actions. The statistics are very high for teens almost 11 die everyday texting and over 80% of people own cell phones.\\n\\nSome people would say is sending that 1 small text important that causing your life or that other person life. Is it worth it because bad things happen everyday even if we don't want them too. Also , you can pull a ride with anyone and if there on the phone and you feel unsafe let them know that but if your scared you risking everything cause you never know what's gonna happen. The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are.\\n\\nIn, conclusion we know that texting and driving both don't get along or work out for people at the end of the day. Teens are the main people who get distracted because either there texting or playing with there friends in the car which seems to be a very bad idea knowing they are so very young. People always make excuses as soon as an accident happens with them. They try to say they were getting something that fell or telling one of there passengers in the back to stop knowing all they have to say is i was texting.\\n\\nI feel like we should have this thing in the future where we get in the car our phones automatically turn off so then there would be no problem with anything. I say this because it's better than doing that one stupid thing then risking however many lives are in thart car.\\n\\nhttps://www. dmv. org/distracted-driving/texting-and-driving. php https://www. icebike. org/texting-and-driving/          \",\n",

Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency situations , listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes.\\n\\nDriving while using a cell phone or drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. If you get a ticket or accident you insurance will raise.                   \",\n",
       " \"Nowadays it have been many car accidents and deaths due to driving while distracted. The main distraction is your own phone. and to me I think this should completely changed around and make it to the point where they should take away when driving. I will talking on why I think the people should stop driving and using they phone.\\n\\nThe reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable,\\n\\nIt turns out that cellphone-use-while-driving laws vary depending on the state that you're in. If you're on a road trip across state lines, troopers might be able to pull you over for something that may be perfectly legal in your home state. You should also be aware of how distracted the other drivers around you might be.\\n\\nSo as you see all the facts of you shouldn't have your phone while driving have just been justified.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accident, but most of those accidents are caused by people on their cell phones. This here is one of the biggest issues the world faces every day with drivers getting their self's in danger and others over a phone call or text message. If you think the slight chance that any of this isn't important and the world is just making a big deal about this, will then let me give a hand and give you a lesson. In 2011s Cell Phone and Driving Statistics, it's estimated that 23% of all car accidents each year are cause by cell phones use. That's 1.3 million crashes and 10 % of those car crashes have been fatal to many others.\\n\\nCause of these accidents many are wondering if people should or should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. If we were to have a week that no one could use their phones for while driving that long the amount of car crashes and accidents could possible or will decrease by the hundreds. Know yes there still will be car crash happening but not by phones anymore, but we really can't do that cause some people aren't going to give up their phones while driving. But there is a better option one that's already being put in place in many states and counties and that laws. Yes, laws are already being test or being placed in many states banning phones while driving now, but they all have a different way of solving this problem. In some states the law only effects teens under 18 or 21 from using their phones when driving hoping to dramatically decrease the chance of car accidents where in other states they don't allow ant one to use their phones at all, for example California has a law that any one 18 or above are ban for using their phones on the roads or anywhere while their using a car, same goes for Hawaii as well. With these laws we can finally decrease the number of crashes, want some proof? In 2017 the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that highway fatality numbers are going down for two consecutive years, it even led in to the first six months of 2018. If we keep it up, we could have much saver highways and neighborhoods for the kids to play in.                                                                                       \",\n",

If your not looking at the rode how are you going to see what's going on you wouldn't be able to see what the cars are doing in front of you. If you are on the phone and you come across a stop sign you wouldn't be able to see and you keep going and you get hit by a car because you didn't have the right away that accident would be your fault because you were on your phone and you wasn't paying attention to the rode you could be on your phone at a red light and the light turns green and your still sitting there because your on your phone. Being on your phone can cause the police to pull you over and give you a big ticket price or worse take you to jail depending on what you did. The hole point is being on your phone while driving causes to many problems so the best thing to do is keep your phone in your pocket while you are driving. Because if you don't you will have a car accident research says that most car accidents that happen the people that caused the accident were on there phone your phone or text message can not be that important to the point were your risking your whole life.   \",\n",
       " 'Technology and Driving\\n\\nHave you ever been riding in the car and looked over at a red light and saw someone on their phone? I see it all the time when I go places with my parents, though we know it is illegal today in GA and other state people still do it. Driving is an activity that requires all your attention. My mom would always you are not only driving for yourself but for everyone on the road. No one should be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle to ensure safety for all drivers and even pedestrians.\\n\\nBeing a driver means you are responsible for your life and others driving and existing around you. Unfortunately, driving accident statistics gathered by edgarsnyder. com says, 1out of every 4 accidents in the US is caused by phone use while driving. That is a large portion of accidents and if we cannot use our phones while driving to rid a quarter of accidents then its worth it. The countless amounts of stories about parents and friends losing loved ones to accidents is an untimely loss that can never be justified, and we should do everything we can to spare people from a hurt such as that.\\n\\nOutside of accidents leading to loss of life because of cell phone use while driving there is also the issue of distractions. A cellphone is like a computer, a MP3 player, a videogame and many other entertaining things wrapped up in one. Using this addictive piece of technology while driving is like asking for a distraction and distractions or lack of awareness of the road leads to car crashes. There might not be any deaths, but a car crash is still something to avoid. Raising your car insurance? A bad thing. Having to get your car or parent\\'s car repaired? A bad and expensive thing. A distracted driver is a driver more likely to crash and damage their own and others\\' property.\\n\\nThere are some cars that have automated cellphone connection and touchless operations. Those vehicles do prevent the distractions, but you could still argue it is still just as bad as drunk driving. Your eyes may be on the road, but your attention is focused towards voice commands to your cellphone. It may be loosely related, but you can still be so focused on listening to that text and voicing a response that you alert enough for all the unexpected things that can happen on the road. People find that to be the compromise, but it\\'s also seen as a mental distraction.\\n\\nOverall cellphones just should not be matched with an activity such as driving. Driving should be a moment to unplug and focus even GPS can be used without the use of your cellphone. Cellphones have been proven to cause car accidents, distractions and crashes. Just keep your hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and attention focused and your cell phone will be waiting on you when you get to your destination.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nStaff, Live Science. \"Should Cell Phones Be Banned While Driving?\" LiveScience, Purch, 12 Jan. 2009, www. livescience. com/3220-cell-phones-banned-driving. html.\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html.

Have you ever been afraid of having your child drive due to the amount of accidents caused by driver\\'s using their cell phone or any other hand held device? Driver\\'s shouldn\\'t be able to use their cellular devices while in operation of a vehicle. Not only because it directs their focus from the road. But it also increases the overall risk of driving on highways and interstates.\\n\\nNow while driving your attention should be on two and only two things, the road in front of you and the driver\\'s around you. If your using your cellular devices while driving that\\'s one more thing you have to pay attention to. Not every human can multitask and those who can aren\\'t able to do it well enough to have one hand turning the wheel the other holding a cell phone typing a response to your bestie about how Jacob is a terrible person while our eyes bounce back and forth between the screen and the road. What if while you take a few seconds to type a word a car comes speeding around the corner and you can\\'t react fast enough to swerve out of the way. According to the studies on Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance in volume 27 number 4 details that multitasking is less effective due to your brain having to mentally shift tasks. Which cannot be afforded to do while driving on a open road with other people.\\n\\nAs well as the fact that driving while using your cell phone increases the risk of driving, not only for yourself but the other around you. Think about it if your distacted you are prone to make mistakes, which can be fatal when driving, if you were to turn a little too sharply or not enough it can easily lead to a crash. That puts not only you and the others in your car at risk but everyone else on the same road as well. According to the National Safety Council texting while driving has lead to an astonishing 1.6 million crashes PER YEAR. Now if the risk of crashing that high why take the chance?\\n\\nNow some people may argue that \"I\\'m a better driver than others i can text and drive\" or \" No way that can happen to me.\" One, get off your high horse their buckoo. Two, According to ACTUAL fact from the National Safety Council 1 in 4 for crashes in the United States will be caused by drivers texting and driving. Is your life really worth a 75% chance that you can get this last text off?\\n\\nIn conclusion, People shouldn\\'t be able to text and drive. If you do you increase the risk of driving which isn\\'t the best thing to do with a already risky activity with roads full of others that you can\\'t tell what they\\'re thinking. But you also distract yourself from the road and it only takes one mistake to cause a deadly crash. So knowing the risks is that last text to Sally really worth your life?\\n\\n1.      ',\n",
       " 'Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn\\'t such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.\\n\\nTo begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver\\'s attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.\\n\\nWhen this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn\\'t a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, \"Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\" This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook. It is a huge distraction and severe consequences will almost always occur.          ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell Phones are the biggest world problem, they have taken over the majority of million human life's. Most of the world uses their phones for communication and simply fun for themselves. Unfortunately, Phones are a very distractive device and can also be very deadly if used in the wrong moment.\\n\\nHumans should not be able to have the capacity to use a phone while driving. The majority of the world think multitasking can come in hand while looking at the road and the phone at the same time. People are taking a risk in their own life and another person's life by making a dangerous decision. Driving with a phone in one hand and the other one on the steering wheel is not what society wants.\\n\\nWhen driving most forget about many things and think they are on a road with no one else. It is easy to forget about sharing a road with other people especially when being distracted by phone. When anyones phones makes a sound when it goes off, everyone is always curious to see what is it. Whether or not if it is a text, call, social media like/comment or anything else can pop on a phone. Humans get the audacity to pick up the phone no matter what they are doing. It is against the law to pick up a phone or even make a phone call to anyone. By doing that people are not only risking their own life but everyones life who is on the road.\\n\\nHands free devices can still be a danger to many with a car. Many say talking on the phone with a cell phone connected to the bluetooth can also be very distracting. Due to the fact that humans having a conversation on the phone while driving, people are more focused on the conversation than they are with driving the car. In most situations , if you cannot simply wait to answer the phone then waiting at a red light might be acceptable or simply moving going to a parked spot.\\n\\nOverall, cell phones should be banned on the road at all times to prevent anyone in danger from others. It may not be as convenient, but the world will not lose as many lives especially in the teenager area. A text, a tweet, snapchat, or instagram is not worth risking your life and others just to get a like or a text back. In the future, phones should not be the reason of deaths around the world and should not increase how many kids or adults have died because of it or someone else fault.   \",\n",
       " 'The use of cellphones while driving is a topic argued about all over the world. Some people think they have the skills to drive while also using their cell phones, but a large number of people disagree with that belief. People should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road, it increases accidents, and it also increases highway fatalities.\\n\\nFirst, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road. Like texting while driving can lead to a ticket. Another one is answering and talking the phone could cause other to have road rage.\\n\\nSecondly, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it increases the risk of accidents. Meaning when not looking at the road you could hit someone pet. Another one is when not pay attention to the road you could hit a tree.\\n\\nFinally, People should not drive while using their cell phone because it can lead to an increase in highway fatalities. When not looking at the highway while your driving you could hit someone in their car. Last year in georgia 1550 people have died in a car accident. Of those 1550 people only 55 were of the use of cell phones. That does not include the number of people being injured of cell phone use.\\n\\nBeing distracted while driving, causing wrecks, and the loss of innocent lives are the three reasons why I think cell phones should be banned while driving. Being distracted while is dangerous. Outlawing the use of phones while driving will greatly reduced the amount of wrecks. If we even save one life by outlawing the use of phones, it will be worth the effort. Help Stop Cell Phone Use While Driving!!!!          ',\n",

People die everyday in car accidents just because they was on their cell phone while driving. We are all attached to our cell phones it doesn't make no sense. A lot of teens are very guilty of using a cell phone while driving. 94% of teens know that it's dangerous but 34% of them still do it anyways. Studies say that approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phone while driving. Texting while driving has lead up to 1.6 million crashes in a year. 1 out of 4 car crashes are caused by texting while driving. Most teens will probably own up to phones while driving. The thing about it is that teens are not the only ones texting while driving. There area lot of adults who do it also. When you are talking on a cell phone it is worse than talking to your passenger. Everytime the driver gets a message or a notification they feel as if they also have to look and respond back to it. I feel as if using a cellphone while driving should be banned and against the law. Everytime you take a look at your phone you are putting not only your life but everybody in the car with you in danger. If it is an emergency i feel as if you need to pull over to the side of the road and text or call who ever it is back. Even if the device is hands free it is still dangerous cause you wont be focused on the road you will be focused on if the device is working or not. When you're talking to someone your brain is not all the way focused on the road it's putting energy in the conversation that y'all are having. It can wait until you reach your destination. Because when you text while drive you have to completely move your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.   \",\n",

Years ago, my sister and I were driving to school as if it was any other school morning. As we approached the green stoplight and midway through the intersection, we were rammed by a truck, who ran a red light. The man in the truck was charged for running a red light and using his cellphone while doing so. This is only one of many accidents that has occurred because of the use of cellphones while driving. Texting and driving can lead to a car wreck, a death or injury of a pedestrian, and are major distractions.\\n\\nCar accidents are almost frequent every single day. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2009 there were 11 million car accidents across the country. According to the National Safety Council, 25% of all car crashes are related to cellphone use, whether by talking on the phone or texting. Although many people think multitasking is always the answer, it is not the case when it comes down to driving. This is because phones are major distraction, probably the most distractive. Also, texting and driving can lead to the injury or death of a fellow pedestrian walking down the crosswalk. Any person on their phone can drive and accidently hit a pedestrian because the driver was too distracted to look down into their cellphones. Cellphones need to be away from the drivers' hands at all time.\\n\\nCellphone use can cause distractions and car accidents, along with the injury or death of a pedestrian. In many states, like Georgia, they have created a law where a driver cannot use his/her cellphone while driving. This law should be in effect nationwide to reduce the amount of deaths caused by accidents; due to the fact that the driver was using his/her cellphone.

But driving while using your cellphone is deadly.\\n\\nLooking down at your phone for 2 seconds could change your life really quickly. Driving distracted can be as dangerous as driving while intoxicated.\\n\\nMost people don\\'t realize the dangers that come with texting and driving. Texting and driving can be as bad as drinking and driving. According to \"arrivealivetour. com\" \"In 2015, there were 3,477 deaths and 391,000 injuries for Texting and driving.\" \"For drunk driving there were 10,265 deaths and 290,000 injuries.\" Texting and driving had more injuries than drinking and driving. This shows that Texting while driving can be compared to driving drunk which would seem more dangerous. Most of the drivers were teens. Teenagers are more likely to be in an accident due to distracted driving.\\n\\nWhen people are driving they don\\'t think twice about being distracted by their cell phone. All it takes is a couple of seconds to get distracted. Those couple of seconds could change your life and the people around you. It\\'s better to use the hands free feature in your car while driving. This will at least help from not looking down at your phone.\\n\\nMost states have laws that help against distracted driving. You can get a ticket for driving while using your cellphone. This has helped bring awareness to distracted driving and maybe even have saved someone\\'s life. 37 states have a ban on all cellphone use while driving. 48 states have a ban on texting while driving.\\n\\nAs our technology increases the risk decreases. Many people use their hands free feature in their car or they use a wireless headset which reduces the need to have to look at your phone. When you get a text message you should wait until you are able to stop and then look at your phone and respond. This would reduce the accidents and deaths over texting and driving.   ',\n",

Either searching the internet, on social media, or sending a text message to somebody but they are making use of their cell phones either way. Should drivers be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. No because people are deciding to use their phone at the wrong time. An there has been just to many deaths dealing with cell phones for ridiculous reason.\\n\\nWe all know the feeling. you're driving and a text messages pops up on your cell phone. You have a reminder you wanna write down, and you really don't think about anything but picking up the phone. Within 5 seconds of looking at the phone , you could be halfway off the road, or already into an accident. Which may cause to injuries or even death. I just feel like whatever is on the phone, or whoever you texting is never that significant to cost somebody else life period. Many others will disagree with my opinion. But when you look deeper into it and really focus you'll understand where i'm coming from.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it's really hard to keep all your focus on the road. Which leads into making it extremely easy to forget that the road is shared by others and not just for one person. For this reason all cell phones usage should be banned while driving. I found on [Teensafe, 2018] that everyday 9 people in america died from a car crash. That has something to do with texting or driving or even being on the phone, and about 3,278 people die in the past 4 years for the same reason. People are just losing their life because others want to be selfish and not think about their surrounding. Not intentionally trying to take life's but just not fully thinking out their action.\\n\\nTexting while driving as we all know, puts danger in many lives. A handful of youngins feels like staying attached to the outside world is way more well connected, than having all attention on the road. Altogether we just need to all stand on it to get a law passed about phone free while we are in our vehicles. In georgia has the same law it's called the hands free law. With this law being passed in atlanta georgia the accident rare, and also the death rate will decrease big time. When other states start to realise hopefully they do the same thing.\\n\\nUsing a cellphone while driving really does put multiple people's life in danger. It's time to put all distractions aside, and focus on what's really important when it comes to driving. As we all know phones have came a long way from generation to generation, and it is interfering in many lives. It's time to stand up for the safety of your life and the people around you. It could be someone in your family in an accident, it could be you. Just by making one change in your life , it can save your life . put the phones down, it can't be more important than a life.                                \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers be allowed on their phone during driving? For my input and opinion I disagree entirely. My personal reason for this is because studies show that being on your phone while driving is a distraction. Everyone else has their own opinion and entirely different perspective and I can see how they would want phones to be legal. As I read more into the use of phones while driving I am introduced to more negatives then positives just because it pulls your attention off the road and even makes you take one hand off the steering wheel. So should drivers be allowed on their phone while driving?\\n\\nMy first reason for why people should not be on their phone would be distractions. Distractions meaning phone calls, face timing, and snap catting. All of the reason i gave are incredibly popular in today's youth and society. As a young and maturing person I use these apps or applications to my benefit when wanting to converse with friends and family. Driving and doing any of those is incredibly dangerous cause it takes your attention off the road and makes you even take a hand off the wheel.\\n\\nMy other reason for not agreeing with having a phone with driving is because it's not just a dangerous thing for you but also for others. In a scenario where two people are at a red light and the person in front is on their phone then how could they know the light is green? It all comes down to the person behind them if they are willing to wait or honk there horn at them. Scenario's like that because fender benders cause now picture if the light turned green and the person just pulled up a little bit and hit the person. Now the person on the phone is at fault for being a reckless driver and interfering with traffic safety laws.\\n\\nDo people driving need to use their phone even if they think it's an emergency? People need to realize that if it is an absolute emergency and they need to answer it then pull over to the side of the road. Most people fail to realize that most phone and car accidents is because someone couldn't just put their phone down for more than five seconds to focus on whether or not the light is green or red. In my opinion and for recent studies that showed it I disagree with using your phone while driving and I feel as if it is a well-deserved law that people should not be on their phone while driving.    \",\n",
       " \"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle, because it can be distracting. You should not use any mobile device, while you're driving because that can cause a very bad accident. It's the majority of teenagers that feel like they can use a cellular device while they're on the road. It doesn't matter if you're talking on the phone or texting while driving, it can distract you from paying attention to the road. None of that doesn't matter at that moment, because you could end up losing your life. In this essay, I will be stating the causes, the consequences, and how to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while they're driving.\\n\\nThere are many dangerous effects of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. Well, one danger while texting and driving is people can become distracted and can cause an accident. Another danger while you are driving and texting or talking on the phone is you can hit a pedestrian. Our brains are incapable of giving our attention to more than one activity at a time. So, this means when you are driving and talking on the phone, you're actually splitting your attention between at least two activities. That's why laws were made to prohibit texting and talking while driving.\\n\\nIf you break the law, there are consequences for texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. The consequences of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving is that you can get a monetary fine, which can be up to $500, depending on what state you're in. You could also get criminal charges for texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving. One of the worst things that could happen is that you could go to jail or prison. This is a very dangerous situation, because you could actually lose your life or take somebody else's life while texting and driving or talking on the phone while you're driving.\\n\\nThere are many ways to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Well, one way to prevent others from texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving is to keep your phone out of reach. Blocking incoming texts or calls is another way to prevent you from texting and talking while you're driving. If you just have to talk, pull over and stop if it's very important, if it's not important, just keep your phone out of sight.\\n\\nTexting while driving is a big issue. People do it everyday, but they don't realize that their lives are in danger and so are others on the road. There are a lot of people dying each and every day, because of phone usage car accidents. Leave the phone alone while you are driving, because a text is not worth a life. That text will be there when you get to your destination. Don't choose to pick up the phone while you're on the road. It's very dangerous, even if it's just talking on the phone for one second.\\n\\nSo therefore, be very cautious of what you do with your phone while you're on the road!                                                               \",\n",
       " 'Using a phone during driving can be very distracting as well as dangerous. Driving already requires concentration so being preoccupied could endanger not only the driver but others as well. Phones also have uses that support multitasking. Despite this drivers still might get preoccupied and lose concentration. I think drivers should only be able to execute something simple like talking on the phone while driving.\\n\\nDriving may look or sound fun but in truth it is very dangerous. Many people lost their lives behind the wheel either because there lack of concentration or a reckless driver. Sur vehicles have air bags but air bags don\\'t guarantee safety. If u guarantee safety pulling out a phone while driving is not recommended. It\\'s okay for non-drivers to have hones out because they do not require concentration.\\n\\nIn conclusion \"should drivers be able to use phones for any reason while driving?\" As stated earlier in the essay I believe talking on the phone should not be a problem for those who can multi-task. Things like texting should not be tolerated because it puts drivers and there passengers at risk. People behind wheels should realize that driving is dangerous.      ',\n",

       " \"Protect us From Ourselves\\n\\nHumans have a strange liking for engaging in behaviors they know are likely to kill them such as smoking, being overweight, hard drugs and the irresistible habit of using a phone while driving a big deadly motor vehicle. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Continued Cell phone use while driving leads in an increase in car accidents, property damage, and deaths. Which is why using a device while driving should be banned.\\n\\nTo begin with, a cell phone regardless of how it's used, whether it's handheld or is used with a headset is a distraction to the driver. The use of a device in any capacity while driving should be banned completely otherwise people will use a creative way to use it without a headset or handheld. Human beings have become so dependent on cell phones that it's hard for us to choose between sending a text and saving our own life or someone else's. Life is short and they shouldn;t make it shorter by texting and driving. Be\\\\fore the emergence of the cell phone, using a device while driving could be compared to reading a book while driving. People shouldn't be putting their life or others' life in danger over such a device. If you were to be driving at 55 mph this is the same as driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed. Being distracted reduces the time a driver has to make a smart decision.\\n\\nFurthermore, aside from this action being a major distraction, using a device while driving can easily be compared to driving while drunk or being under the influence of drugs. This could lead to fatalities. The increase of accidents caused by using a cell phone while driving has risen dramatically over the years as technology continues to grow. People have creatively come up with ways to use a device hands free. The difference between talking on a hands free phone and speaking with someone else in the car, unlike the person on the other end of the call, the person sitting next to you knows what is happening around the driver and the vehicle. The passenger can alert the driver at any given moment.\\n\\nLastly, using a device while driving a vehicle should be a crime. For one people are putting themselves in danger as well as others. They don't realize the type of impact that can be caused in their life and others. Making the wrong decision of using a phone while driving can result in someone's death. Cell phone use while driving results in an increase of property damage. Could be anything from another person's car to even a building.\\n\\nIn conclusion Banning the use of a device while driving can save lives, and prevent property damage.

       " 'Should people be texting and driving?\\n\\nEven though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren\\'t worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.\\n\\nIn any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person\\'s head while on their phone is what\\'s happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It\\'s already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The\\n\\nWrath of Khan, \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn\\'t.\\n\\nAlthough, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.\\n\\nAs a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself\\n\\n\"is this really worth it\"? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that\\'s not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it\\'s not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don\\'t use your phone while driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nArmstrong, Ari. \"Spock\\'s Illogic: \\'The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few.\\'\" The Objective Standard, 29 Oct. 2019, www. theobjectivestandard. com/2013/09/spocks-illogic-the-needs-of-the-many-outweigh-the-needs-of-the-few/.\\n\\n\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving.\" Federal Communications Commission, 10 May 2019, www. fcc. gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving.

       " 'Phones and driving aren\\'t a good thing to do at the same time, in fact it\\'s illegal and if the police find you they can fine you from $20-thousands of dollars, Suspension or revocation of driving privileges, Points on one\\'s driving record, Mandatory road safety classes and Vehicle impoundment, especially if great bodily injury resulted from an accident. Every day in the United States around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and around 1500 are injured in some way in crashes by these irresponsible, distracted drivers. One of the most dangerous, distracting activities that many people do is texting while driving. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill other people. When a person is texting, she/he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. This is very dangerous because it could make the driver lose control of the car and slow her/his brain\\'s reaction time in case of a potential accident.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is very important that we find some ideas to break off this bad habit of texting while driving. I think that one of the easiest and best ways to break this habit is simply to turn off your phone. In this case, the driver wouldn\\'t be distracted by the ringing or buzzing of the phone, and it wouldn\\'t tempt the driver to text while driving. Another way to break this habit is to download some of the new applications that can disable cell phones while people are driving. Also, there are other applications that automatically send a text to whoever is texting the driver to tell that person that she/he is driving and that the text will be answered later. There are a great variety of applications to choose I think that we can use these to help us with the problem of texting while we are driving. Additionally, if a driver is waiting for an important call or text and has company in the car, the phone can be given to a passenger to check it out. Also, there are some programs that are helping to raise awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and to keep it from occurring. In these anti-texting programs, people can drive in a simulated situation, where they are driving but also texting, and can see how many accidents are caused by this problem. In fact, in 2011, at least 23% of auto collisions involved cell phones. That\\'s about 1.3 million crashes! Not only that but texting while driving is actually more dangerous than driving while being drunk or high on marijuana. Every year almost a million people in the United States get into accidents, the majority: teens. Unfortunately, the number just keeps increasing.\\n\\nThough texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don\\'t think it\\'s a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives. In a 2012 Cell Phone and Driving Statistic, it is reported that 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured due to distracted drivers. Furthermore, it is said that talking or listening on the phone increases the risk of crashing by 1.3 times while reaching for a device is 1.4. Dialing is 2.8 times more risk of crashing while texting is 23 more times. Additionally, talking on a cell phone and driving at the same time can make the driver\\'s reaction time to be as slow as that of a seventy-year-old. To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn\\'t work on some people, you can use S voice or Siri to command your phone to read out your messages or to reply back. This will allow your eyes to focus on the road instead of your phone. No more reaching for your phone to text \"Lol\" or \"Lmao\" and endangering your own live and many others. Though you are still talking while driving, it still decreases your chance of crashing. An app in smart phones that works similarly to the method I described before is called DriveSafe. ly. Basically, it reads your text messages and emails out loud and has a customization auto-responded.\\n\\nIn conclusion using your phone while driving can cause/ lead you or others to bad injuries maybe death. To stop people from texting and driving, one of the major phone companies, AT&T, address this problem by creating the AT&T\\'s It Can Wait to text and driving campaign to spread awareness. Many stories and documentaries are also posted online to support this campaign. You can also join millions of others who have signed the pledge to never text and drive and to instead take action to educate others about the dangers of it. If you still believe you can get home safely by texting and driving, AT&T\\'s simulator will prove you wrong. It gives you a real-life experience of texting and driving. With this game, you\\'ll only find out that it\\'s not as easy as it sounds. Before you look at a text, remember that it is not worth dying for. But preventing the usage of these everyday devices is very simple, yet rather difficult, and will save lives if it work out. Accidents are deadly to many people, so creating an environment for everyone is better in the long run. As a young adult, I plan to use some of these ideas and promote these websites and encourage others around me to do the same.       ',\n",
       " \"Required Essay\\n\\nThe average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent.\\n\\nThe use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations. One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is.\\n\\nThe person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car. The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone.\\n\\nPhones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone. A second could save them from a life threatening accident. The amount of people that are in car accidents that involve phones is 26% in 2014. When the person is using their phone they are putting themselves and other people at risk on the road. According to the National Safety Council, the use of cell phones when driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually.\\n\\nTexting while driving would be the biggest issue when it comes down to the use of a cell phone. According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk. Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car. The amount of consequences for just the use of a phone is just not enough, is the phone as important as the person's life? It should never come down to that question because your life is way more valuable than sending a text to someone while driving.                                                  \",\n",
       " \"In today's society being on your phone while driving is a big problem. Using a cellular device while operating a vehicle can often lead up to death or serious injuries. Drivers should not be on their phones while driving, they should be paying attention to the road and everything around them.\\n\\nReason people should not be on the phone while driving is because you have to not only be safe for yourself but people around you. People don't always drive cars you have people on motorcycles too. There has been a rise in deaths on motorcycles because people have been paying more attention to their phones and by the time they look up it is too late to react, and now someone life is taken cause of these cellular devices.\\n\\nThe Law has really cracked down on texting and driving now if they see you with a phone they are pulling you over. People who text and drive are 6 time more likely to get into an accident, the average amount of time a driver takes to type out a message is about 5 seconds. (driversalert. com) AT&T Teen Driver survey found that 97% of them think it's dangerous but 43% of them still engage in the activity. National Safety Council says people using cell phones while driving leads up to 6 million accidents (driversalert. com). A university in Utah study says that a teen driver using a cell phone has a reaction time of 70 year old woman.\\n\\nEveryone can do their part to cut cell phone usage keep yourself and everyone around you. Bring down the death percentage from texting and driving lets be safe and smart when we are operating a vehicle. Les put down the cellphones and keep our eyes on the road and look for pedestrians and people on bikes. Lets change our way of driving lets drive safe.\\n\\nHope this changes everyone mind about texting and driving, and seeing how dangerous it really especially when you are not just dealing with your own life. But the lives of others everyone should really see how distracting having a cell phone in the car is.     \",\n",
       " 'Texting & Driving\\n\\nTexting while driving, also called texting and driving, is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, email, or making similar use of the web on a mobile phone while operating a motor vehicle. Texting while driving is considered extremely dangerous by many people, including authorities, and in some places have either been outlawed or restricted. As a form of distracted driving, texting while driving significantly increases the chances that a driver will be involved in a motor vehicle accident.\\n\\nResearch by the NHTSA suggested that an estimated 660,000 drivers use their phones during daytime driving. According to a report issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation, drivers between the ages of 20 to 29 are the most likely to text while driving. The International Telecommunication Union states that \"texting, making calls, and other interaction with in-vehicle information and communication systems while driving is a serious source of driver distraction and increases the risk of traffic accidents\"\\n\\nThe scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or driving while texting, is limited but growing. A systematic review study at the Queensland University of Technology Centre for Accident Research and Road\\n\\nSafety-Queensland CARRS-Q found that visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing have a detrimental effect on a number of safety-critical driving measures. Specifically, negative effects were seen in detecting and responding correctly to road signs, detecting hazards, time spent with eyes off the road, and lateral position. Mean speed, speed variability, lateral position when receiving text messages, and following distance showed no difference. A separate, yet unreleased simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related crashes when texting.\\n\\nThe low number of scientific studies may be indicative of a general assumption that if talking on a mobile phone increases risk, then texting also increases risk, and probably more so. 89% of U.S. adults think that text messaging while driving is \"distracting, dangerous and should be outlawed\". The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has released polling data that show that 87% of people consider texting and emailing while driving a \"very serious\" safety threat, almost equivalent to the 90% of those polled who consider drunk driving a threat.\\n\\nDespite the acknowledgement of the dangers of texting behind the wheel, about half of drivers 16 to 24 say they have texted while driving, compared with 22 percent of drivers 35 to 44. A survey of more than 90 teens from more than 26 high schools throughout the United States conducted by Liberty Mutual Insurance Group in 2006 showed that 46% of students consider texting to be either \"very\" or \"extremely\" distracting. An American Automobile Association study showed that 34% of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel because of texting and 40% of American teens say they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone in a way that put people in danger. A study involving commercial vehicle operators conducted in September 2009 concluded that though incidence of texting within their data set was low, texting while driving increased the risk of accident significantly.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn my perspective, I think drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. The reason why I say this is because people don't pay any attention to what they are doing because they so caught up in their devices. Driver can get killed and they can hurt somebody else if they are using their cell phones. They not only putting their life in danger, but also somebody else's life too.\\n\\nDrivers can be drunk while driving and be on their cell phone and end up killing themselves. Instead of being save and advoiding that risk that they are doing right now, they are being very dangerous of themselves and others. That's why now in today's history, it is rare that people pull over on the side of the road to be on their cell phones. The ones who do that are very smart because they aren't taking a risk to hurt themselves or others.\\n\\nYou have to be careful of what you are doing when you're in a car driving and being on the phone. That's why today, a lot of people buy a cell phone holder to put in their car. The reason is that they can talk on the phone but also pay attention to the road so they won't get in a car crash. It is just crazy that people would not think about what they are going to do when they are using a cell phone when they are driving. That's why for me, I think it would be safer just to buy a cell phone holder to put inside your car so you can talk but also pay attention to the road and what you are doing.                                             \",\n",
       " \"Can Cell Phones Be Used While Driving?\\n\\nMany people today think using cell phones while driving are good ideas. When phones are being used in the process of driving you have a higher chance of causing an accident in the road. Some may also say that having your phone out helps you multitask things at once in a car so it would be a good thing. They would say you could send documents off if your late to work, if you need to order a gift for a person or even call someone to pick up something for you at home. Using a cell phone is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashing. Many people argue and say driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone. In the U.S. the amount of car crashes due to distracted driving is increasing. Today I will be talking about how it is not a good idea to drive and text.\\n\\nIn this paragraph I will be discussing why it is bad to text and drive. When driving sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road. Using a phone while driving decreases the awareness on the road which leads to more car crashes. People will notice when you are on your phone and try to drive ahead of you just in case something might end up happening. Having kids in the car and you are on the phone talking is a big risk to you and the kids. The drivers on their phones will be paying more attention the person their talking or texting instead of the road.\\n\\nWhen driving you have three distinct groups. The first one is visual distraction it involves taking your eyes off the road even if your looking at a GPS system or trying to check a child's seatbelt. The next one would be manual distraction it involves you taking your hands off the wheel. It happens when you are searching for something in a bag or trying to eat something. The last is cognitive distractions it happens when you are not mentally focused on the purpose of driving and instead everything else is important to you and the road is not.\\n\\nThere are associations that work towards getting people to drive more safer on the road. The AAA (American Automobile Association) says that the older they are the less likely they are to get in a crash. However, those drivers under the ager of 24 are in a higher risk of an accident because their minds are still being developed into the adult stage. Parents are losing their children because of phones being used on the road. Save a child's life and stop the use of texting while driving.\\n\\nIn this conclusion having a phone while driving is dangerous and reckless. Always worry about your life first before you even think about touching your phone. Help stop deaths and save life's so children can go home and see their parents. Getting home to an family safe and sound is a better feeling than losing your life to an electronic device.      \",\n",
       " \"Phones And Driving\\n\\nHave you ever looked beside you and seen someone texting and driving? It is actually a law to text, call, or just be on your phone in some places. It is very dangerous it can cause a wreck, running red lights, or running someone over. I think you shouldn't be on your phone while your driving or even at a red light, if it's a phone call than maybe. Nearly 1.6 million wrecks happen from cell phone use while driving and 390,000 are injured or killed from that.\\n\\nSome states made a law about this because it is very dangerous. 47 states have the hands free law. If you get caught the punishment is a fine that cost as little as 20 dollars all the way to 500 dollars. Another punishment is getting charges and your licenses changed to Class B. Not all states have made this a law yet because they don't see the concern.\\n\\nMost people don't see the dangers but peoples lives get taken from this and drunk driving. People run red lights, run over people, or get in bad wrecks because of this. A couple examples of this is if a kid is getting off the bus and your texting and driving you could run over them or someone is walking across the road and you are texting and driving and run a red light and hit them. Also if your speeding and hit the tail end of someone while your on your phone while driving.\\n\\nIn my opinion you shouldn't text and drive. One it is a law and you should follow laws. Two it is very, very dangerous for yourself and others. If it is so important to risk other lives pull over or go into a parking lot. If anything call them, do not text them and when you call pair it to your car or truck.\\n\\nInstead of risking your life and others just stay off your phone until you get where your going.

       " 'Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.\\n\\nIn essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nCell phones haven\\'t been around a long time but they have become a very big part of our daily lives. Phones have went from something you use to just call people, too your very personal computer, up to date will all the new software to make surfing the internet easier. Now, that sounds wonderful but these thing can also so be a huge distraction to many. Especially when they are being used while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nFor one thing, using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions. It is easily possible for your eyes tom slip off the road. The Tampa Bay Times claim that it \"takes seconds to get your eyes off the road and into a car accident\". Therefore, instead of your eyes being locked into your phone, they should be focusing in on your speed, the road, and the traffic. At the same time, your mind can only process so much. According to Goldsborough \"the human mind is not capable of texting and driving\". Other people have also confirmed that \" driving is a one mind chore\" meaning that the mind cannot to both at the same time. In addition, your mind need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Thus, concentration is important while driving and breaking that concentration causes a risk for an accident.\\n\\nSecondly, texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well. Texting while driving can limit your response time to something like a car pulling out in front of you, a child or adult walking in front of you, and other things. Texting someone means that you have to put all of your attention into what you are texting which, so if you are driving and texting at the same time you are bound to miss something that you should have been paying attention too or you can hit something that you should have been paying attention too, like a car, animal or even worse a person. A article called \"Texting While Driving\" states that texting and driving has become a \"prominent social issue, and it\\'s the most hazardous practice that risks accidents to drivers, cyclists and pedestrians\". A pedestrian can walk onto the road at anytime but it is up to the driver to pay attention to road and avoid endangering his/her and the pedestrian life.\\n\\nFinally, the numbers speak for themselves, too many accidents have occurred as a result of people texting and driving. People\\'s lives will always be endangered if people feel like the best time to call their mom or girlfriend is when they are driving. If we can just wait until we arrive at our destination before having to pick up the phone while driving then we can avoid a lot more accidents and more lives will be spared. Remember, think before you pull out your phone to text someone while driving because life is to precious and short enough already.   ',\n",
       " \"Cell phones are owned by most people in today's society around the world. While they are generally harmless to the users, there are instances when irresponsible use of cell phones can result in injury or death. The most common example of this is driving while using cell phones. The use of cell phones while driving should be banned to prevent unnecessary harm\\n\\nAccording to the US department of transportation 2,841 people died as a result of distracted driving. Driving while using the phone is the leading cause of distracted driving. When sending or reading a text while driving 55 is the equivalent of driving the entire length of a football field without looking at the road. Using a phone for tasks that cause the driver to take their eyes off the road should be prohibited to reduce these unnecessary deaths.\\n\\nIt is clear that texting and driving should be made illegal to ensure that drivers are not reading a message while driving, however using a navigation system or answering a phone call hands free while driving results in limited to no time not looking at the road. Consequently, the laws should be limited to using a phone in a way that takes the drivers eyes off the road for longer than a blink of the eye. This will ensure the driver is able to use valuable tools but do so safely.\\n\\nDrivers who use cell phones while driving are driving distracted. The result of driving distracted is nearly 3,000 needless deaths each year. In order to reduce the number of people injured or killed by distracted driving. While any use of a cell phone while driving can be considered driving distracted, the worst part of cell phone use is texting while driving. Therefore, it is important to limit cell phone use while driving to tools that can be used hands free and do not require the driver to take their eyes off the road for longer than a blink of the eye.    \",\n",
       " \"Using a phone and driving is bad because if you take your eyes off the road for a min anything can happen you can get hit by a car or you can hit a person or better yet a kid. People die or get injuries every other day just by texting and driving. Nearly 390,000 is being injured just by texting and driving.\\n\\nTeenagers do it the most taking a video of they self driving and texting they girlfriend/boyfriend. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. It only takes 1 sec for a accident and I don't think people know that. Some teenagers like to have friends in the car it only takes that one friend in the car to stop you from picking up that phone because you have someone else life on your hands. No, I'm not saying that using your phone and driving is worse then drinking and driving but it's just as dangerous. Teenagers should be careful God forbids but it could be them.\\n\\nPeople should get wireless headphones so when someone call. Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving.\\n\\nTeenage drivers should read and study up on driving safe because if they don't they could get hurt. 36% of respondents (aged 18-24) admitted to texting while driving. Texting while driving increases by 400% a drivertime spent with their eyes off the road. 4,637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use.             \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nDrivers shouldn't be able to use cellphones in any capacity while driving because the risk of them harming themselves or others around them on the road increases dramatically. Most humans own and operate cell phones every day of their lives, for some people it's part of their daily routine. Using a phone while operating a vehicle comes with great dangers. Some argue that in some cases, people need to check their phone or be on it while on the road, for directions or informing whoever where they are.\\n\\nTo begin with, driving while using a phone can cause the driver to swerve in and out of lanes. This brings a greater risk of getting in an accident with other drivers around them, that might also be on their phones not paying attention. Additionally, when a driver is looking at their phone that means they are not looking at their speedometer or the speed limit on the road they're driving on. The faster a person is going the more damage that is done to the vehicle, if you went into a ditch, off-road etc. Not only just their car in some circumstances but also the other persons car if they hit someone else. In some states, its fully illegal to be on a phone while driving. Which means they would be pulled over and given a ticket for speeding and being on their phone.\\n\\nAdditionally, in the other hand some could argue that people should be able to use their phones while driving. Due to phones being used for navigation or for getting in contact with someone while they are driving. There has been plenty of devices invented that hold your phone for you, to make it easier to use GPS, maps, etc. Some messages people receive are too important to not be on their phone, or to not at least check their phone. There really isn't a valid argument to why people should be able to use their phone on the road, because in every scenario its dangerous to them, and the others on the round around them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using a phone while driving is never going to be on the safe side of things. The risk of causing an accident is too high, due to other people around not paying attention to the road and the person on their phone not paying attention to others on the road. There's no valid argument to say that it is safe to do so, because every opinion thrown out there has a bad side to it. At the end of the day, just don't text and drive or use your phone while driving.\\n\\n[Last Name] 2            \",\n",
       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nI believe that car drivers should be able to use their phone while driving but not over a certain speed limit so that if they get distracted they are not going that fast therefor there is a less chance of being seriously hurt. This new law could help a lot of people and even save lives.\\n\\nImagine that you're driving down the road at 30 miles an hour your mom is calling you but according to the new law you can't even touch your phone while in the car. I find this very absurd given that the chance of one dying at this speed is very low. Now imagine going 70 miles an hour and your mom calls you of course you should not pick it up because the chance of dying at this speed is way higher.\\n\\nI believe that it should be left up to the people if they want to kill themselves by being distracted. Then let them kill themselves. At one given time there are 660,000 people on their phones while driving and 1 out of 4 accidents are caused by using a phone when driving. The best route is to inform people of the dangers instead of just incriminating it.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, it is illegal to even touch a phone while driving the only way to be able to talk is a hands-free device. This a very smart choice on the safety side of issues but on the personal side it can mess a lot of people up because they need to be able to access their phone. That's why they should not incriminate it but there should be open statistics and info about crashes and fatalities due to these crashes.\\n\\nIn conclusion I believe people should just make better choices because you never know it could just save your life. The best choice right now though is to invest in a hands-free device, so you won't be distracted, and police can't give you a ticket for talking on the phone. in other words don't touch your phone unless its super important because nothing is more important than your life.   \",\n",
       " 'In today\\'s society, people all over the world are practically glued to their phones. Compared to when cell phones first came out, technology has evolved into an important item that we carry. You can do everything from buying music, paying bills, buying gifts, even completing homework on a cell phone. Even though cell phones has become one of the most useful tools that we use, sometimes we need to know when to put it away. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it can lead to horrific accidents, the consequences could be expensive, and in the long term it effects everyone.\\n\\nCell phone usage is the number one cause of auto death and/or injury. \"Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver.\" (National Center for Statistics and Analysis) 1 Even if you are not on your phone while driving, someone else could be and you could easily become a statistic. Teen drivers are more than likely to get into car accidents because of the constant use of the phone. We can bring the number of deaths down but putting our phone away.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use your phone while driving. If you are caught on your phone while driving, you will receive a ticket. These tickets can cost between $50-$2,750 depending on the number of offenses and type or driver. According to drivinglaws. org, \"Depending on the circumstances, a texting or cellphone violation could also lead to a reckless driving conviction. And if one of these violations results in the death of another person, vehicular homicide charges are a possibility.\" Although there are some expectations to using your phone such as reporting traffic accidents, medical emergencies, fires, criminal activity, or serious road hazards, it is safe to use your phone only for emergencies and nothing else.\\n\\nI can honestly say that everyone that I know has been effected by a car accident. Although I never been in one, my sister has been in an awful car accident and it has affected her mentally and physically. She has scars on her head which affects her self-esteem, she gets nervous while driving sometimes, and at the time of the accident, she needed help eating and getting dressed which caused the whole family stress. Just imagine if you caused someone to die just because you had to send a text message. How would you live with that? Car accidents can cause PTSD, adjustment disorder, depression, driving phobia, neurological damage, and substance abuse. This can affect not only the person who was injured in the accident, but it can affect the driver who caused the accident.\\n\\nIt is never that serious to put your life or anyone else\\'s life in dangers because of a text, call, or social media. It is not worth the money and stress to be on your phone and drive. There are stands made for your phone that you can use in the car that way your hands can be on the steering wheel at all times. There are also bluetooth headphones you can use so your hands can be on the steering wheel as well. In my opinion, the best option is to put the phone in the glow compartment, purse, arm rest, or wherever in the car you cannot reach. There are no positive outcomes from using your cell phone while driving, it can only lead to disasters.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1. \"Motor Vehicle Safety.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 9 June 2017, www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html 2.

       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nLots of people always argue about being able to have their phones while driving, but that shouldn't be debatable. Not only do you put your life in risk, but you put other peoples life in risk. So many car accidents are caused because of texting and driving, most these accidents involved by teens. You should not be using your phone while you drive. Doing that puts everyone around you in danger. So is one text really worth it, is it worth putting your life in danger and others. It is extremely dangerous, because once you are on your phone you can't take your eyes off your phone.\\n\\nEveryday in the United States Of America around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and those drivers are distracted by their phone, causing them to lose control of the vehicle, putting people at risk of losing their lives. Texting and driving has been the biggest districation in the world. Every year, 21% of fatal car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were the result of using their cell phone while behind the wheel. This will increase 4% every year, and will be the resulting in more car accidents. No only do teenagers text and drive, but one fifth of an adult in the united states has been texting in driving.\\n\\nSome people believe just because they are good drivers and it's just one text, nothing bad can happen but that is completely wrong. One text can change your entire life. It does not matter if you are a great driver like you may think, no one is a good driver. If another person who is being distracted by using their phone, they are not being a careful driver, in a flash of your eyes, you are putting your own life in danger because of the actions you are choosing to follow, which also puts the people around you in danger.\\n\\nSome people argue that if they take their eyes off the road to look at their phone. No harm is being done to anyone, but so many things can happen in that one second for example a car can break and by the time the driver looks up it might be too late. There has been so many terrible car accidents, have killed kids, a mother, a father, a love one, and sometimes an entire family. When you get into a car accident and the cause of the accident was because you were distracted by your phone and you end up killing someone or causing them to go to the hospital the driver can end up in jail, because you shouldn't be on your phone when you are driving, If something is important and you need to be on your phone, you should pull over or park somewhere and then continue to drive, but you should never text in drive to put people's life in danger.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving while texting should not be debatable because it is the most dangerous thing in the U.S. and its increasing and increasing every year and every day. That being teens of age 16 get in the most car accidents. There should be a law to prevent this, no one should lose a loved one because of a car accident involving the driver being distracted, because there could've been so many things done to prevent that. Losing control of a vehicle is so easy and dangerous when you get distracted by your phone. All accidents involving a driver being on their phone is totally preventable when you just leave it alone.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nI feel like drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel this way because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving has been the main cause for most car accidents. Car accidents that can potentially lead to death or a serious injury. Not only are people putting their life at risk, but they're putting others life at risk as well. Texting can wait and should never be done while driving.\\n\\nOperating a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. When your vehicle is traveling at 35 mph that means you are moving at 16 meters per second. So, in those few moments your eyes were on your cellular device instead of the road. This means you have moved far enough to not see a school bus, a kid playing, or a vehicle braking in front of you. Just reaching for your phone could be deadly as well.\\n\\nTexting and driving has caused 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 injuries also occur each year due to texting and driving. Also 1 out every 4 car crashes occur due to texting and driving. Responding to a text while driving can distract a driver for around 5 seconds. At 50 mph this is enough time to travel the distance of a football field.\\n\\nHonestly, I've seen so many people texting while driving while I was a passenger.\\n\\nI didn't feel safe at all. It's almost like feeling like I'm in the car with a drunk driver. Seeing people drive reckless makes me wonder what's going to happen. I think that driving while texting should be banned completely.\\n\\nSo basically, cellular devices and cars are like oil and water. They don't mix well at all. If you take cellular device use while in cars out of the picture, this will benefit the world in many ways. There will be less car crashes, injuries, and deaths caused by distractions. Its simple cellular devices should not be used while operating a vehicle for any reason unless there is a life or death emergency. Taking them away from those operating cars or even bikes could save lives.             \",\n",

       " \"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometime we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones like driving while being on it. As a society we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and health as well as others because we can't put our cell phones down.\\n\\nMost people are guilty of using cell phones while driving. Although have we ever thought about it's danger? Five states plus Washington D.C. have hand-held bans and many states have bans for specific drivers. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving.\\n\\nIn April, 2009 in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team were unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. You start to think to yourself is a cell phone worth all the dangers?\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can try being careful because the money you put towards careless accidents that can be prevented can be put to the light bill etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving driving.\\n\\nInsurance companies are just waiting for you to mess up so they can increase your insurance. Don't fall for it, your cell phone can wait till your out of the vehicle or when your parked. Especially with the new hands-free law in Georgia with some real expensive tickets so my best advice is to stay off your phone in the vehicle.

As crazy as it sounds its true people tend to crash more likely while using a device and driving than under the influence. We are so focused on social media or other people texting us that most of the time we aren\\'t paying attention to the road. Even if you\\'re at a red light and you use your phone your still most likely to crash because of the fact of the fact that you\\'re not aware when the light turns green. If you simply cannot resist the urge to check messages or talk on the phone while driving, take the time to pull off of the roadway and park your vehicle before picking up your cell phone.\\n\\nDriving other people in your vehicle is a huge responsibility, which most of teenagers take that lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle.

       " 'Phone Usage While Conducting a Vehicle\\n\\nSince the beginning of modern technology there has always been a debate on the subject of using electronic devices while conducting a vehicle. There are many opinions on this subject, some more elaborate than others. Should people be allowed to use their phones while driving and possibly putting people\\'s lives in danger? Although we can argue that there are many beneficial ways that you can use your phone in the comfort of your vehicle, the debate on whether it should be used at all is the main problem.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council reports that the usage of electronic devices while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (prg 4). 1 out of 4 accidents are caused by texting and driving (prg. 4). These statistics prove that a couple of seconds from a minor distraction can literally be the difference between life and death or major injury. Full attention is needed while driving and nothing should obscure that for the safety of yourself and others.\\n\\nIt is a given that your attention should solely be on the road ahead of you but sometimes you need directions to certain places and that dilemma can be solved quite easily with the use of modern technology. In today\\'s society phones and GPS devices have built in voice command programs such as \"Siri\" or \"Google Now\" and even \"Waze\" that specifically helps you navigate your music while driving. These innovations were created to help decrease accidents and further simplify your phone use and make it more accessible at any time.\\n\\nEven though these programs exist on people\\'s cellular devices accidents still occur because of careless driving. So it is safe to say that phones can be used while driving but with immense precaution. If drivers are careful they can safely conduct a vehicle while using technology but must continue to keep most if not all their attention on the road. Safety of others is very important as wee as personal safety and that should not be more important than anything during your time on the road.\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n-https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html         ',\n",

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it will hurt or harm their loved ones, it can make someone can occur penalties, and it can cause lifetime injuries. First, we will talk about how it can hurt or harm loved ones.\\n\\nThere are numerous accounts of people who harm their family or friends by being on their phone while driving. Since people are driving while they're on the phone, they are more susceptible to hitting someone or something else since their eyes aren't on the road. Research shows that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.\\n\\nEven if someone doesn't hit something themselves, they can be in a position to cause someone else to hit them by mistake. If their family or friends are in the car with them, they will be affected by the crash. Next, we will see how operating cell phones while driving can cause a bad driving record.\\n\\nThere are serious repercussions for texting while driving. It is important to know the penalties one could go up against. It can cause a bad driving record since it is a serious offense. Many people receive higher rates and increases on insurance after receiving citations and being involved in accidents. When a ticket is received for not paying attention to the road, some places give jail time or suspensions of licenses. Also, some have to pay a generous amount of money for fines and violations of the law. Let's move on to lifetime injuries.\\n\\nSome people obtain lifetime injuries from texting and driving if they don't die. Each year 390,000 injuries occur from accidents caused by texting while driving.\\n\\nReports state that one out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused for the same reason. These accidents can cause loss of body part or disabilities. In the end, the chance of continuing on with a normal life becomes slim.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we know that texting and driving can cause detrimental results. It is important to become selfless when having the option to be on the phone while operating a vehicle. Accidents do not only affect the driver, yet any and all parties and passengers included.

       " 'PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nTechnology has extremely increased in today\\'s generation. Many people have a tendency to rely on their devices while driving. Phones are very addictive to have. People surely can\\'t get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They will look at the phone while doing everything. The main problem that is occurring is that people are texting while driving an automobile. Should or shouldn\\'t drivers be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nI believe drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their cellphones while driving unless for navigation. It\\'s extremely dangerous to look of the road to send one simple text messages. For example, if you are driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn\\'t be able to use your cellphone while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason that you shouldn\\'t be able to use your cellular device while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of \"answering a quick text\" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people\\'s lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.\\n\\nThe last and final reason is that it\\'s illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!\\n\\nIn conclusion, people shouldn\\'t be able to operate a cellphone while driving, unless it for directions, a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. It\\'s okay to want until your done driving to use your cellphones! So please keep your eyes on the road and don\\'t pick up the phone.

       " \"Cell phones play a huge part in today's society. They are used in our daily lives by letting us gain access to the internet, communicate around the world, and much more. They are life savers for many, but can it also cause tragedy? In many scenarios, these devices can put one in danger, especially while driving. Some may think otherwise but in capacity, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nSee cell phones, in most cases, are distractions from reality. Many aren't focused nor are they aware of their surroundings. Being in that state of distraction can cause minor slip ups such as simple as tripping over a rock. Now imagine one being behind the wheel with this distraction. In this scenario, a person is in control of a fast-moving vehicle. Being distracted while operating a machinery that can put you and others at risk is nowhere near safe nor okay. People increase their chances in crashing even for just looking at a notification for a second. If someone is in a situation of being distracted because of their cell phone, there's a high risk of drifting off the road, hitting another car, or even an innocent pedestrian. It also puts their own life in danger as well as the fellow passengers.\\n\\nBeing distracted with a cellphone while operating a vehicle is comparable as being under the influence.\\n\\nWhile being under the influence of any sort or alcohol or drug, people tend to not be aware that they are in a position where they can injure or even worse put innocent people in danger as well as themselves.\\n\\nDistracted driving and drunk driving both have similarities but they also differ in one major thing, the decision. The person that has the choice of checking their phone also has the choice to not. They decide to either put their life in danger or make the smart, right decision to focus on the road. That small action of not checking your phone, whether or not you know it, saves you and as well as other pedestrians lives. The choice is up to them.\\n\\nMany people think of it as futile information when being told that using a phone on the road can lead to fatal deaths or major accidents. These warnings should not be taken as a joke. Even if you confidently ponder that you can multi-task and that you'll be fine or it won't happen to you, the possibilities are endless. About 9 people die everyday due to having or being a distracted driver. Over 1,000 injuries are due to this.\\n\\nToday, there are families grieving over loved ones that were lost due to these incidents. It just takes the person behind the wheel to realize that lives are put into their hands. So leave the phone alone and remember, better left unread than dead.         \",\n",

No matter what were on our phones, but should we be on our phones while we are driving. Most people would say no to this because it distracts you from the road and it puts everyone it the car at risk of an accident. 80 percent of people who have crashed was on their phone calling someone or just texting or watching a video. They get to distracted with YouTube, snapchat, Instagram, twitter and reedit. Maybe they were on them for a second and was looking away from the road then someone pull out in front of them and they couldn't react quick enough. They just hit him now their child in the back is now seriously hurt or the people in the other car are hurt too. People still think it's a good idea to let people drive with their phones. Imagine your child in the car first time driving and someone not paying attention because they were looking at their phone come out and hits your son. You wouldn't be happy and u would not like to lose your son/daughter with a dummy that was staring into his phone. it's not safe for people and it can cause some serious harm. I'm not saying u can't check your phone but do it at stoplight or use it when u need your GPS. Do not look at it 24/7 while u are driving it deteriorates your reaction time and make you end up in a hospital.    \",\n",
       " 'Phones and driving\\n\\nIn my opinion I believe that people should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Reason why is because teenagers or even adults have died from using their cell phone while driving. In fact, if people drive while using their device there is a 99% that they will get distracted causing them to not focus on the road,which means also causing an accident. For instance, about one year ago I experienced texting and driving and it wasn\\'t a good experience. I was accelerating at that moment and for some reason I thought I was capable of multitasking by using my phone and driving because my parents had kept on calling. I was trying to decline the phone call and after I did I had decided to go on social media, which was a very bad idea. I then ended up hitting a car that was in front of me because I did not notice that it was braking. so, once again i do believe that people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.\\n\\nhttps://www. cnbc. com/2015/05/21/cell-phone-boom-leading-to-rise-in-distracted-driving-safety-g roup. html\\n\\nIn More phones More wrecks?

For example, The Collision-Avoidance Technology in cars are now available in cars for drivers. Hersman thinks that with this being in the vehicle drivers would be less distracted and can also help them on being focused towards the road. He also had mentioned that cars are also being developed by companies such as Google and are will also help drunk drivers and also teen drivers as well. Advanced cars like these can also reduce the amounts of billions of dollars of people who wreck and also which would highly benefit taxpayers from and of these wrecks. A con thing about the car and technology is that for some people it\\'s bad and also cannot focus that way either.\\n\\nhttps://www. cnn. com/2015/02/17/living/feat-brutally-honest-teens-texting-driving/index. html Fifty-five percent of young adult drivers say that it\\'s easy for them to text and drive and another thirty-four percent of of them have stated that they have driven on the road while on the phone (Wallace 2016).The risks and percentages of accidents caused by texting and driving have raised up tremendously in the U.S. more than Eight people die caused by driving and at the same time while on their phone. On the other hand 44 states have made it illegal to drive and text states such as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands etc. Center for Disease Control and Prevention has also allegedly reported that more than a thousand people are injured in crashes that have been reported to inlove a distracted young driver whose been most of the times accused of accidents. Janis Brett Elspas, a mother of four children also said that while texting and driving shares and says that she might be one of the few drivers who has never checked her phone or grab it at all while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nMany people might say and agree to themselves that it\\'s easy to operate a vehicle while driving because they think they are capable of doing it. Most of the result at many times end up in a accident and end up regretting what they\\'ve done and kept in mind that they were capable of when they really weren\\'t. Many of adults tell and ask them for the favor to not drive a car and use their phone but i think that most of these kids in the generation don\\'t understand because they\\'ve never been in an accident or experienced texting and driving and end up in a car crash. They might have the excuse to say \"oh I\\'m in a rush and I\\'m in a emergency\" etc. but they don\\'t realize it\\'s not worth it because they don\\'t think about the consequences after wards. Some of adults might also eat while driving and still get distracted while driving. They\\'ll reach for some fries and just by taking of a second off the road could end uo the biggest time of their lives.\\n\\nOnce again In my opinion I think that drivers in general should not be at any time or for whatever reason on their phones. However even if I say that they shouldn\\'t it wont do nothing about it because everybody has their own opinion like I have mine. States,agencies,companies etc. have been against all of driving and texting because by experience and they know how young teenage kids are. People who have experienced this have never done it again i know because ever since i did and went through whatever I did i\\'ve never grabbed a phone while driving. I don\\'t think that technology will benefit in any type of way except the gps while operating a vehicle in any effective way.   ',\n",

It is said that in the United States around 1 out of 10 people are killed by distracted drivers everyday because they choose to put their attention towards texting instead of focusing on the wheel. In today's society mostly everything is run off by technology and its how nowadays we communicate with one another, but there are moments when it is necessary to put down your devices and it's when you are driving a vehicle.\\n\\nThere are many methods on preventing texting and driving and one is simply just putting your device down and not use it when behind the wheel. Another way to prevent texting and driving is using a cell phone stand which prevents you from looking down at your phone but instead having the phone next to your view of the road. If anybody else is in the car let they should wield the device while the driver is operating the vehicle and let them know if any important notifications appear. These methods just take very little time so they can prevent a risk of taking the driver's life or anybody who is at risk of being a victim of a distracted driver.\\n\\nIt is believed to say people are more likely to die in a car crash by a distracted driver rather than a driver who is drunk or under the influence of marijuana. Even if that is to be said, there are still people that are confident enough to multi-task and risk the chances yet they don't know their reaction time is slow as an elderly due to them paying attention to several things at once which causes a commotion in the brain.\\n\\nPhone companies such as AT&T have tried preventing these kind of things by starting a campaign and having traffic signs say things to prevent drivers from being on their phones while driving.

       " 'Should people be allowed to use their cell phone while driving a vehicle? The answer to that question is a very complex one. You would have to be very specific when it comes to this because you have texting while driving, calling someone/ answering a phone call while driving, and lastly using social media while driving. Using your phone while driving is definitely a risk, but it also depends on what you are doing on that cell phone.\\n\\nTexting while driving is by far the most dangerous this to do while driving a vehicle. When you are texting you take your eyes off the road many times. In the time you look at your phone to text someone back, you leave an opening for potential car accidents. For instance, let\\'s say you get a text from an old friend and you decide to text back. In the time you are texting back you run a red light and someone crashing into you. You most definitely prevented that if only you weren\\'t texting. While you are driving you don\\'t need any distractions, its just you and the road. I know that people are not stupid and wont take their eyes off the road for a very long time, but lets just say that you arent looking and the other person in the other car was distracting too, there is a more likely chance for a car accident in that scenario.\\n\\nCalling someone or receiving a call from someone while driving is not as dangerous as texting while driving. The reason for this is because, when you are having a conversation on the phone you don\\'t have to be looking at the phone in order to talk. You could place the phone on your lap and just talk. You still have your eyes on the road and talking on the phone. Yes, sometimes it can be dangerous. That\\'s only if you let the conversation be more important than your road safety. Being on the phone while driving is still risky and yes, you could probably also get in an accident. The thing is, it\\'s less likely than texting while driving. It is more safe to be on the line with someone else while driving than to text someone because texting you are constantly looking down. Anything could happen, but you don\\'t need to be looking at your phone in order to speak to them on the phone.\\n\\nBeing on social media while driving is a definite no, it is as bad as texting while driving. You are only distracting yourself while being on social media while driving. That is something you could do when you get to your destination or when you get home. Being on social media is not important enough to risk your life over. Why would you ever put liking a picture on instagram over the safety of your life. Texting and being on social media are more dangerous than anything else. You might think it\\'s stupid like \"omg why would anyone ever be on social media while driving\" but trust me, a lot of people do it. Apparently checking someone\\'s snapchat story is more important than your life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, i say that being on your phone while driving for the most part is not okay. The only thing i know for sure is that taking a phone call while driving isn\\'t as bad as texting and driving. Be safe while driving and don\\'t do anything stupid, keep your eyes on the road at all times. If you must answer a text at least wait until a red light so that it is less risky for you and others.    ',\n",

However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. \"Even though we as humans recognize that talking or texting on a cell phone or using social media apps while driving is unsafe, they often engage in these behaviors anyway\"(Foss and Teft). So if people don\\'t make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents also say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don\\'t eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. \"In 2017, distracted driving was reported in crashes that killed 3,166 people (8.6 percent of all facilities), although many instances may go unreported\" (Foss and Teft). It\\'s also proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn\\'t interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn\\'t in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack of manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can\\'t find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. \"Texting while driving is the most dangerous activity on the road, even more dangerous than drinking and driving\" (\"Injured in a Car Accident by Someone Using a Cell Phone\"). People shouldn\\'t fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable.\"You cannot drive safely unless the task of driving has your full attention. Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing\"(Andrew Currin). Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations .\\n\\nConcluding, if people don\\'t give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people\\'s responsibility to not incur their own and other people\\'s lives.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAndrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov. \"U Drive. U Text.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones were first introduced to society in 1980. Throughout the world, cell phone usage has grown very quickly because of the ease of connecting with anyone in the world. People can pick up their phones while driving to text or answer calls while causing many accidents and taking lives. It is proven, that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting the attention of drivers and increasing road safety concerns.\\n\\nBillions of people throughout the world are using cell phones in their daily life. Cell phones have become a necessity for many to function better in their daily lives. Cell phones today are considered less fashion and more of a utility providing several benefits. Cell phones are much more than just communication devices.\\n\\nThey are used as radios, video players, and mini-personal computers. Cell phones are used for business and personal convenience while providing safety and comfort.\\n\\nStudies have shown that using cell phones during driving makes the driver more exposed to fatal accidents by taking the focus of the driver from driving to a cell phone. Drivers are trying to divide their attention between driving and their cell phones. Driving deserves undivided attention. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on activities happening around them. Cell phones distract drivers' attention, resulting in slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events.\\n\\nAlthough there are many cons for cell phone usage during driving, one must present the pros as well. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is the security factor. During emergency situations, cell phones can provide help and the driver can make emergency calls. They can also be used for reporting situations that could be accident-causing. Cell phones are also used as navigational tools.\\n\\nThis paper has presented the pros and cons of cell phone usage while driving. In conclusion, despite an effective way of communication, cell phones should not be used while driving.                        \",\n",

Driving is a big responsibility.\\n\\nOver the years, the number of death have increased because of all the unnecessary car accidents caused by those who are driving and being on the phone. There have been many accidents some injured and some killed. People should understand that driving is a big responsibility. While operating a vehicle you need to think about those around you. Let's say, you are operating a vehicle and you on your phone texting and you get into a car accident. Now they have to call your close ones and tell them the tragdey news. You will put your loved ones in a worried situation. Do you really want that? Honestly there should be no a reason for that to happen. Reason one you should not operate a vehicle and be on your phone.\\n\\nAlso, you can prevent from getting tickets or from getting your license suspended. Getting a ticket for operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone is a waste of money, a phone call, message and social media can wait. Therefore, you do not want your license to be taking away. Having a license is very import, it's the main thing you need to drive, so if they take it away you will not be able to operate a vehicle. You must know your opportunities that you have, take advantage while you can.

       " \"PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nA great majority of the world owns cellphones. Cellphones have become a major problem in our society; therefore, drivers should not be allowed to operate their phone while driving. The reason why individuals should not be able to operate their phone while driving is because they are a major distraction, they cause a lot of automobile accidents, and they negatively impact teenagers who are learning to drive.\\n\\nOne reason why people should not be allowed to operate cellphones while driving is because; cellphones are one of the most common distractions that lessen the driver's ability to concentrate. A hands-free device will not even help, because engaging in a deep conversation takes the drivers focus off of driving. Furthermore, passengers in the vehicle are already a big enough distraction to the drivers because they are converting with the driver. So it is much safer if the driver just let them change the song, text, call, or whatever needs to be done on the driver's phone. Many people do not understand how dangerous these phones are when improperly used. Primarily, this is why cops are giving tickets to violators, to encourage them not to do it again.\\n\\nSecondly, cellphones are the number one cause automobile accidents. People have wrecks every day from a cellphone, because all it takes is one glance at your phone, and you could easily run off the road. The road is a very dangerous place; therefore, operating a phone while driving is something that you do not want to do.\\n\\nLastly, parents who use cellphones while driving negatively impact teenagers who are learning to drive. Ids generally look up to their parents, and if they see them on their phones while their children are in the car they are influencing them that it is ok to use a cellphone while driving. It is safer, if the driver needs to use the phone, to just pull over. It is the drivers responsibility not to risk their life nor the lives of others everyday people are dying from using their cellphone while driving. When someone takes their eyes off of the road to look at their phone. If the driver is on their phone while their kids are in the car, that puts them in danger and such behavior teaches them bad things.     \",\n",
       " \"Cellphones are a big role in today society should they be used while operating your vehicle. Or should they stay in your pocket. Distracted driving has become dangerous practice on our roads and highways.\\n\\nIf you need a reason to stop texting and driving you shouldn't be driving in the first place. first of all it illegal to do and its very dangerous you could hit another car or hit someone in the road. Some more reason are consider the people you have in the car when you text and drive you are also putting the passengers at risk when you do so. Another one is think about other people driving. you could hit a family driving home and kill all of them if you text and drive. Think about the consequences next time you think about picking up your phone while driving.\\n\\nSomethings you can do if a text is really that important you can pull over and then send the text. Although many cars and trucks today now have buttons on the steering wheel where you can press one button to pick up a call or to text someone back. If you drive older model cars you should maybe invest in a new car or even a more hands free phone. There are about 3,477 people who died from texting and driving back in 2015. Just be careful on what your doing while driving make sure you keep your eyes on the road at all times.\\n\\nNext time you go out on the road think about what could happen if you look at your phone while driving.

       " \"Phone & Driving\\n\\nUsing cell phones while driving is a world wide hazard. Everyone knows that using a cell phone while driving is a terrible idea. People still think that drunk driving is more dangerous than being on your phone while driving. But you're more likely going to get into accidents if you're on your phone while driving than drunk driving. Most people use cell phones while driving because they self-esteem feeds off social media. They want to stay up to date and see if there's any negative or positive feedback on there photos. They post a picture 10 minutes before going into the car and while they are driving they get a notification so they pick up their phone, dying to see the comments on and they recent picture. The mostly happens around teen drivers, and it's more dangerous for them because they are inexperienced. They won't know what to-do if they ever get themself in a particular driving situation.\\n\\nWhen a teen just get their licences they're most likely going to give their friends a ride home from school or wherever. The percentage of being in an accident increases because the odds of being distracted increases. Distracted driving is a huge problem these days, especially with the easy access to a cellular phone. Most of the time when driving, drivers have younger people and young children in the car with you. Being older than these people, you are, in many respects, a role model to them. Most of the time they can't do better because when they parents are driving with them, they're on their phones so they follow.\\n\\nsome times, it can be very easy to forget that the road is for everyone that can drive and not just for you. Sometimes driving pickup their phone for a minute and then they get too deep into the drama and forgets all about driving and the traffic. They also have slower reaction time to if they were to ever get into an accident. By time they should look up and have to step on the breaks, the car had already hit another car or already ran off the road. As new people start to drive, they start using cellphones and they just add them-self to the amount that's already doing. Checking your phone for messages, snaps, tweets, etc is a serious distraction. It can be fatal and the victim be seriously injured.\\n\\nIt can claim innocent lives and it should be banned. By doing this, it will lower the accidents caused by cell phone usage while driving. It's also bad for the drivers too because if a driver hit another driver it's going to cost them a lot. They insurance is going to pay for all the damage he/she'd cause and the repair of the victims cars and the monthly insurance payment is going to skyrocket. Every state should pass some new and more effective laws so that it could teach drivers that text and drive a lesson.\\n\\nNo driving should be able to text and drive or be on their phone while behind the steering wheels of a vehicle period. It's one of the most dangerous driving Distraction that could take the lives of innocent people. It could cost you a lot just by looking at your phone for a second, and increases your insurance bill. Texting and driving is a horrible idea and no one should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. If someone decides to disobey this law they should be punished fairly for the crime of breaking the law.   \",\n",
       " \"Majority of humans own a cell phone and use on a daily basis . Cell phones are useful for many things now, like to call , text, using GPS or maps , searching things up. Cell phones are easier to use and can be taken anywhere. Nowadays people start to use cell phones while driving which is dangerous. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones because it distracts you from safe driving.\\n\\nWhen driving and texting at the same time you may put other people in danger. You putting those people in danger because your not paying attention on what's going on. In those few seconds of you looking at your phone you wouldn't know what could happen.\\n\\nYou can hit someone thats walking or you may hit another car if its stopped or if its moving. You also prevent another car get into an accident. You can also end up going on to the other lanes without you noticing.\\n\\nDriving and texting in the car alone is putting yourself in danger. Your calling and texting , it don't matter what your doing your not knowing what's going on in the few seconds that your distracted. By you looking at your phone you can run a red light which would also get you in trouble, you'll get a ticket for running the red light. You running the red light could make you cause an accident with the other cars that are moving or the ones that are stopped, or may cause another car in an accident.\\n\\nDrivers with passengers wouldn't be safe either. You are most likely to cause more people in danger. With so many people in the car you could be more distracted with your phone and with the passengers in the car. Most likely drivers that text and drive and have passengers with them are the ones who get in the worst accidents. The driver could run into a building, run red lights, crash into other cars, move to another lane because they distracted. Most of the times the passengers get hurt in the accidents not the driver but there may be a point where everyone does.\\n\\nMost of the humans now own a cell phone and use on a daily basis. Most people drive and text which shouldn't be allowed. Its increasing a risk on not getting into an accident or for anything to happen. Drivers should just focus on the road and not their phones. So drivers shouldn't drive and use their phones because the drivers, other people, and passengers may get hurt.    \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn today\\'s day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don\\'t have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a fine of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.\\n\\nThe first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It\\'s been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,\"This one is pretty obvious, but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year. If you don\\'t want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don\\'t text and drive.\" These statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldn\\'t overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesn\\'t get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that states,\"Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\" This article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it\\'s okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it\\'s never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and don\\'t know how to multitask. A car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash.\\n\\nThe second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they\\'re with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,\"Not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap.\" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people\\'s wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you\\'re willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that says,\"Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving. According to research conducted at Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks.\" This article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someone\\'s mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers. Putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity. Texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right.            ',\n",
       " 'Driving can be extremely dangerous for you or anyone else, especially if you\\'re not careful and focused. While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, \"an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone.\" The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn\\'t the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety.\\n\\nCell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver\\'s hand. Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations. One of my resources states, \"Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well.\" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, \"texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk\". Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver\\'s reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only.\\n\\nEven a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who\\'s calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. The National Safety Council reports that, \"answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that\\'s enough time to travel the length of a football field.\" Anything can happen while you\\'re driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel.\\n\\nIt is statistically proven that the cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes with nearly 390,000 injuries each year. Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road. Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that \"nothing will happen to them\". In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn\\'t dangerous, but the facts say otherwise.\\n\\nIn conclusion, don\\'t operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you\\'re trying to multi-task which means you\\'re playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn\\'t want to be put in.            ',\n",
       " 'Driving while using a cellular device is very dangerous, but it can be useful at certain times. The use of cellphones ranges from informational, to recreational activities. The use of cellphones during driving can be catastrophic not many people have the skills to watch the road and their phone at the same time. The fact of the matter is that it\\'s too dangerous to let people use cell phones while they drive, the accidental crashes that happen each year would skyrocket. I advocate for a ban of drivers using cellphones while driving.\\n\\n\"Approximately 660,000 drivers try and use cellphones behind the wheel of an automobile\" according to edgarsnyder. com. This is extremely risky as not being focused while driving can lead to death by car crash, not just for the driver at fault but everyone in the crash. The drivers of America need to be attentive when operating a vehicle because of: pedestrians, stop signs, public and or private property, cars, trucks, etc. The mortality rate of people in car crashes are very high, and the property damages done are very extreme, not to mention that it can cause problems later in life as well. Overall it\\'s not even worth the trouble to use your cellular device while driving.\\n\\nTo look at the perspective through another person\\'s shoes is the key to understanding why this is true. The thought of leaving this world or being the cause of someone else leaving this world is enough for me not to even think about using a cellphone while driving. The hearts of the family members who had their loved ones taken away makes me tear up. A great man once told me, \"all life is precious and it is not up to man but our creator to take it away. \" There is nothing more wrong than knowing that you took a human life and that is the reason I think cellular device use during driving, should be illegal.

       " \"Nowadays technology has advanced so much that we use our phones in our everyday life. However, is it good to use your phone at all times, there should be a time for when to use it and not to use it. That is why people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is a huge distraction, it could cause serious accidents, and it's not necessary while driving.\\n\\nAlthough phones have become a huge deal in our life they are also a huge distraction from the world around us. When is the last time you took time to look up at the sky and the world around you, can't remember? That is because everyone is always looking down at their phones and some people don't even leave their house because these phones. So if you are on your phone and driving almost none of your attention will be on the road; you will be more worried about what is going on in your phone rather than what is in front of you. Some people even live off just their phone and need to check it frequently, so that could become a big problem if you are on the road and need to make an important text or call.\\n\\nWhile on the road with a lot of cars being on your phone could cause a lot of accidents. You may not know it but looking down at your phone while driving could swerve your car out of your lane. This could cause major accidents and could harm you or the people around you. There has been plenty of accident where people were on their phone not paying attention and crashed because of it. Driving and phones just do not go together, it is the same as driving drunk because you do not have your full attention on the road. It is never safe to use your phone while driving especially because you do not need it.\\n\\nDriving could be complicated for some people but your phone is not necessary while driving. You should already be concentrated on the road and the things going on around you. Driving requires you to pay attention the road and the signs on the road so you can know what is coming up or if a road is closed off. How will you know if you are to focused on your phone to notice anything around you. That is why your phone is not necessary while driving because it just bring distractions to you. This is why phones have a driving mode so you cannot receive messages while driving so you can be safe.\\n\\nOverall it is important to know that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it is a huge distraction from the road. You should also focus more on the road or you could cause huge accidents to many people. The thing you need while driving is you because phones are not necessary while driving they are just too much of a distraction already.              \",\n",

On the 30th of March 2013, A 20-year-old truck driver was texting and driving, hitting a mini church bus in Texas. This resulted in the loss of thirteen innocent lives. Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. And news stories like this cause a lot of controversy behind the usage of cellphones while operating a vehicle. Despite laws and bans placed on the use of cell phones while driving, each driver is accountable for their decisions on whether they wish to use their cell phone while driving.\\n\\nOperating a vehicle while using your cellphone has proven to be fatal to both parties; the operator and his company. Just by texting and driving, you are six times more likely to be in a fatal accident than those who drive intoxicated. On August 27,2013, eighteen-year old, Kyle Best, caused on accident while he was texting his friends. The case stated, \" Plaintiffs Linda and David Kubert were grievously injured by an eighteen-year-old driver who was texting while driving and crossed the center-line of the road.\", and also later stated\\n\\n\"Best\\'s cell phone record showed that he and Colonna texted each other sixty-two times on the day of the accident, about an equal number of texts originating from each.\" Grieving parents, children, and spouses say goodbye to a loved one because of someone or their loved one\\'s mistake.\\n\\nAlthough there has been a decrease of deaths of people texting and driving, people still use some type of electronic, such as a global positioning system (GPS), to navigate and take others around. Taxi drivers are the main people having to change routes multiple times a day. This can be dangerous because they are risking their lives just to make a living and they don\\'t even realize it. Inexperienced cab drivers who are hired from phone applications such as Uber or Lyft, statistically have a higher chance of being in a car accident than those who work full time and have years of experience.\\n\\nAround 2007, states started placing laws against texting while operating a vehicle. So, to the thousands of people who do it; It is illegal. Texting and driving is just as risky as driving under the influence, which means you are just as likely to get caught. In Georgia, all distracted driving charges are misdemeanors, which means they could be charged with just a monetary fine unlike others which can carry jail time. Distracted driving also gets you points on your license, and not the good kind of points. According to an online source, by getting distracted driving ticket can lead to insurance companies raising your rates. Each state and insurance company have different restrictions so it is unsure of how much they may raise it.\\n\\nDespite laws and bans placed on the use of cell phones while driving, each driver is accountable for their decisions on whether they wish to use their cell phone while driving. Texting and driving affect the lives of thousands and millions of people are affected due to these actions causing fatalities and economics conflict. People need to take in consideration that they are not the only ones risking their lives while driving and texting. With that being said, no one should not be able to use their phones at any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nLozano, Juan A. \"Witness: Truck driver in Texas crash that killed was texting.\" 31 March 2013. usatoday. com.\\n\\n(Linda Kubert and David Kubert v.

       " 'Phone & Driving\\n\\nWhen driving sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they can create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Buzz Maven Labs, says he came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on their phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers who use cell phones while driving is also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person life, but she made a poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with the rest of her life.   ',\n",

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that it is safe because they can drive using two hands or there knee at times . however, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations.\\n\\nAlthough some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving and that it can wait until they get home. people who work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and scary situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.\\n\\nBecause of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phones have become an addiction to the human race. We as humans tend to use them for everything in our lives. People use their cell phone for communication, social media, alarms, schedules planning, etc. Often times people are so distracted by their cellular device that people use them at the wrong time. One of those wrong times are when people use their phone while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous for people to use their phone while driving.\\n\\nThere are a lot of issues that can come with using your phone while driving. Others lives are put into danger, fatal car crashes, accidents and using your phone shows that you are willing to risk your own personal safety. According to the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging (teendriversource. org). \"Statistics show that the use of a cell phone behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (teendriversource. org).\"\\n\\nDistractions from cell phones cause death rates to go up. Society has a bad addiction of being on their cell phones for long periods of time. This addiction is causing people to be distracted while driving. Many people have been in car accidents where people were brutally injured and some have had fatal accidents. Not only did the distracted driver hurt the opposing driver but the loved ones of the opposing drive goes through a lot. Their loved one might be hurt and need full time care or they may have to plan a funeral.\\n\\nSituations like these should make us think about the actions we take. Society should pull away from their phones to save others lives and save heartbreak from others. Most adults think it is the teenagers that are causing the problems with distraction of cell phones. Adults are a big problem when it comes to being distracted with cell phones while driving. However, society should not accuse each other but we should work together on making a change in cell phone usage.\\n\\nIn conclusion, society should take time out and stop being selfish about using their phones while driving. People should stop trying to check their messages, read the latest tweet, or catch up on the latest post on instagram. Society should think about the safety of themselves and the safety of others. Waiting until your next destination to check your phone could help bring down the death rates of fatal car accidents. Our states have laws in place that demand that we don\\'t text while driving. People have bought devices to hold their cell phone on their car dash but that doesn\\'t help. The driver tends to look a the phone instead of the road. They especially look at the phone when making a video call. The purpose of driving is to arrive at our next destination safely. Face to face conversation should be practiced more and that could decrease the use of cellphones while driving. Everyone should stay safe and keep the world safer by focusing on the road and not our cellular device.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\n\"Cell Phones.\" Teen Driver Source, Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia, https://www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones.\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html\\n\\nRogers, Mike. \"Facts About Cell Phones and Driving: Safe Driving Facts.\" Drive, 20 Nov. 2018, www. drive-safely. net/cell-phones-and-driving/.

       " 'According to the NHTSA \"In a split second, you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone you love.\" This can happen with cell phone usage while driving. To be more specific, you have to look at your phone in order to text and you have to look at the road in order to drive. Which makes cell phones a distraction while driving. Therefore drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause distracted driving which can lead to accidents and danger to pedestrians.\\n\\nDriving while distracted can be anything that takes your attention off the road and on to something else. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death among teenage drivers. According to a survey conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, more than 90 percent of drivers know texting while driving is dangerous. Recently there was an accident in Tennessee caused by a bus driver who killed three victims because he decided to text and drive. Texting and driving is dangerous and deadly.\\n\\nAnne McCartt, is a senior Vice president for the highway safety says in the article, \"No Phones, Safer Roads\", that \"Whether hand held or hands free, talking on the phone while driving increases your risk of having a crash.\" This is true because driving with your head down or eyes on something else can cause you to possibly lose control of the wheel and increase your chances of having an accident. For example you cannot expect to walk around with your eyes closed and not hurt yourself. It is the same as with driving you cannot drive with no eyes on the road and not expect to crash and cause hurt to you and your passengers.\\n\\nAlthough some people may think that using hand free devices is okay. However, going hands free does not actually prevent the driver from being distracted. Because they still have to put hands on in order to answer the phone or text. It can actually be just as distracting as hands on for the driver. .\\n\\nDo you know how many people have died in 2018 due to texting and driving? Well it\\'s most definitely tragic. In 2018 about 3,287 people have died because of texting and driving. Which is a good thing that they made no texting and driving a law. When you\\'re distracted, who\\'s driving? Make sure you think twice before picking up your phone while driving.      ',\n",
       " 'Distracted Driving: Why Texting and Driving Should be Illegal\\n\\nTechnology has advanced tremendously in the realm of communication, the smartphone is not only a means of communication but an essential tool now for people\\'s careers, entertainment and staying on top of current events. As useful as they are they understandably receive a lot of our attention. A time they should be ignored however is while we are behind the wheel. Texting while driving takes both your hands and eyes away from the road and one is distracted even further while they respond to a notification. The proliferation of the smartphone has led to an unfortunate increase in texting related accidents, especially in teens. Cars are huge dangerous machines that can be fatal tools when handled irresponsibly and a person responding to a text or email is a major distraction that can cause damages to yourself but also the pedestrians and other drivers on the road. These damages are statistically the leading cause of accidents for teens and among the most fatal causes for accidents.\\n\\nThe cars of today have come a long way from the first gas powered automobiles of the late 19th century. When Karl Benz, the Benz in Mercedes-Benz, first drove his newly developed Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886 it ran on a single cylinder engine and could reach a maximum speed of 10/mph (Defree). Today, technology has enabled the Koenigsegg Agera RS to reach a top speed of 277.9 mph making it the fastest street- legal production car (Gibson). It\\'s easy to forget just how immense car are when they can take across us cities and seem so compact. Surprisingly, the average weight of a car to be is 1.4 tons or 2,871 pounds. This is from looking at the mid-size models of all the major car companies, with mid-size cars being those falling between compact cars and full size cars and SUVs. The average SUV weighs in at 4,799 pounds which is 40% more than the average car. They don\\'t seem that big when you step inside them. They maybe even feel a bit cramped when you have a lot of passengers. But when the engines starts up and we accelerate to speeds of 60 or even slower road speeds of 40 cars can be very dangerous. In fact any car moving at any speed can be enough to kill a person. At lower speeds the fatality has more to do with the health of the person and manner in which they are hit. Such as elderly person being knocked backwards and hitting their head by a car backing up at only 5 mph. the chances of survival are quite high , decreasing incrementally until about 30 mph. at which they likeliness of death is then at 50 %. The seemingly small increase to 40 mph pushes that number up to 90% (Kill Speed). The physics of a car crash are simple, the energy is transferred from the vehicle to whatever it hits, whether that\\'s another vehicle or a stationary object like a pole or person. A car weighing in at one and a half tons traveling what, to a drivers seems slow, speed of 30 mph is carrying a massive amount of energy. Which when impacted with another person can cause injuries that if the victim were to survive would change their lives forever.\\n\\nDriving a car even a short distance means you wield a nice amount of power over pedestrians and anything else that doesn\\'t measure up to the your cars size. So it is imperative that when you\\'re behind the wheel of a car the road should have your full attention. In the event that something strays across your path that wasn\\'t meant to you should be alert enough to respond to any sudden roadway dangers and make a decision that will ensure you and those around you are safe. A driver\\'s reaction time is doubled when they are texting and driving. In\\n\\nJim Forsyth\\'s article on a small study at Texas A&M University analyzed the impact of texting on an actual road. In the study 42 drivers between ages 16 and 54 drove on an 11-mile (17 km) test course. Once while sending or reading received text messages and then again while their focus was entirely on the road. The researchers also asked participants to brake when they saw a flashing yellow light during both scenarios and recorded their reaction times. Without texting the driver\\'s average reaction time was between 1-2 seconds, but while they were texting it increased to 3-4 seconds. This was regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text. The study also found that if a driver was texting they 11 times more likely to miss the flashing light. A few seconds isn\\'t a long time but the difference even one second would make is enormous. On highways where people average anywhere from 70-100 mph cars cross football fields in the same amount of time. Striking a person at this speed would undoubtedly result in their death. But a collision with another is much different much messier and much more hazardous situation altogether. Statistics place distracted driving as being the cause of 20\\n\\n% of all fatal crashes and cell phones are one of the main distractions.\\n\\nTexting and driving has very real consequences. In the United States a majority of states have bans on cell phone use while driving. 16 states prohibits the use of hand held devices while driving and 47 states ban texting while driving. No state has a total ban on all cell phones but 38 states and D.C. forbid any cell phone use by teen drivers and beginner drivers (Essex). The legislation is well deserved. As the usage of cellphones has increased so has the number of teens who get injured or, even worse, die as a result of texting while driving (Ricks). Researchers at Cohen Children\\'s Medical Center estimate that there are 3,000 at least teen deaths in America each year from texting and 300,000 injuries. With the number of teens who drink and drive taking a sharp decline in recent years it is now the leading cause of death. Driving under the influence of alcohol results in a projected 2,700 deaths and 282,000 injuries suffered from car crashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. From 2013 to 2016 the rate of unintentional accidents led in injury related deaths for teens (Howard). And of those accidents car crashes accounted for 62 %. These are staggering numbers and it\\'s upsetting to know that they could be avoided with safe driving practices. While laws can be passed and enforced they can only do so much. Still their existence proves that texting and driving is very much a growing epidemic that will continue to affect more people than it has today. Should people realize the laws aren\\'t there to simply inconvenience them but to protect them as both drivers and pedestrians perhaps they will become more effective.\\n\\nWhen a person gets behind the wheel it is ultimately their decision to practice responsible driving habits. It is hard to imagine that a person who regularly drives would be oblivious to the dangers of texting and driving. Whether is through nationwide data being reported or the coverage of local accidents a person will see the dangers of this bad habit eventually. Hopefully with the passage and enforcement of laws they will be more inclined to put their phones down for a brief moment. If that isn\\'t enough maybe the sobering knowledge of just how powerful their vehicle is would be enough, a car is intimidating figure while it is stationary and while moving it\\'s even more deadly. Such a powerful device should be used responsibly.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nDeffree, Suzanne. \"Karl Benz Drives the First Automobile, July 3, 1886.\" EDN, AspenCore, 2012, www. edn. com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4376656/Karl-\\n\\nBenz-drives-the-first-automobile--July-3--1886.\\n\\nEssex, Amanda. \"CELLULAR PHONE USE AND TEXTING WHILE DRIVING LAWS.\"\\n\\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, National Conference of State Legislatures, 30 Apr. 2028, www. ncsl. org/research/transportation/cellular-phone- use-and-texting-while-driving-laws. aspx.\\n\\nForsyth, Jim. \"Texting While Driving Doubles Reaction Time.\" Reuters, Thomson Reuters, 6 Oct. 2011, www. reuters. com/article/uk-driving-texting/texting-while- driving-doubles-reaction-time-idUSLNE79500W20111006.\\n\\nGibson, Dean. \"The Fastest Road Cars in the World 2018.\" Auto Express, Dennis Publishing Ltd, 31 July 2018, www. autoexpress. co. uk/best-cars/89044/the-fastest-\\n\\nroad-cars-in-the-world-2018.\\n\\nHoward, Jacqueline. \"A \\'wake-up Call\\' about What\\'s Killing America\\'s Young People.\" CNN, 1 June 2018, cnn. com/2018/06/01/health/youth-injury-death-rate-cdc- study/index. html.\\n\\nRicks, Delthia. \"Study: Texting While Driving Now Leading Cause of Death for Teen Drivers.\" NewsDay, 8 May 2013, http://www. newsday. com/news/nation/study- texting-while-driving-now-leading-cause-of-death-for-teen-drivers-1.5226036.\\n\\nSafe Speed. \"Kill Speed.\" Kill Speed, Safe Speed, 2007, www. safespeed. org. uk/killspeed. html.

       " \"Driving and Using Phones\\n\\nDriving a car requires lots of focus. It is not something to try and multitask with. Majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Cell phones can be a major distraction while driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nTrying to use a phone while driving can be very dangerous or even life threatening. Anyone can easily look down for a second and instantly be in a car wreck. No one ever understands what life changing things can happen in such a short period of time. Not only can the person using their phone while driving be severely injured, they could also injure someone else or even kill someone. For example, if a person is driving and they are on their phone. And they hit someone, resulting in killing them. That person will get charged with vehicular manslaughter. Where they can end in jail for up to six years or maybe even worse because they were on their phone. Then their life is ruined.\\n\\nAnother reason why people should not use their phones while driving is fines. It is not only dangerous to do so but can also be pretty expensive, fines can be up to a hundred and fifty dollars and tack on a point to their driving record. For most teenagers when they get up to 4 points on their record; their license will get suspended.\\n\\nAlso no one can actually focus on two things at once it is actually physically impossible.\\n\\nIf their brain is focused on their phone. Whether they talking on the phone, texting, or checking social media; their brain is paying attention to that and not the road in front of them.\\n\\nUsing a phone while driving is not safe and definitely not worth the consequences. Make smart choices and don't use your phone while driving. Your life may depend on it.                                                                           \",\n",
       " \"Distracted Driving\\n\\nPeople say that using cell phones while driving is a hazard and that is affects everything you do. I believe that using a cell phone to text or do anything that requires you to look away from the road is hazardous. However, I believe that using your phone to call is not hazardous because you are not focused on the screen, therefore it does not obstruct your view of the road. This is not a bad rule to be able to speak on your phone.\\n\\nThey rate of fatalities in driving incidents have skyrocketed over the years because of cell phones but I believe only looking at your phone causes the accidents. If you were on the phone, on a call, and not looking at your phone then you wouldn't be in as much danger. Stats show that at least nine people are killed every day because of distracted drivers, but it doesn't tell what they were doing on their phones. The distracted driver was most likely looking at their phone, due to texting or social media. If you're talking on your phone and not looking at it then I believe there would be fewer accidents.\\n\\nIn 2015, most teens admitted to texting while driving. When people started to see the dangers of it, using phones while driving slowed down. However, there are still a lot of things that people do that help the cause accidents. The crashes that happen now are made out of ignorance and not caring for what they are doing, but its harming people.\\n\\nIn conclusion the texting while driving scene is bad and we should stop doping it and we should allow phone calls because they are less dangerous and it still allows conversations and work to be done.            \",\n",
       " 'Why Phones Shouldn\\'t Be Used While Driving.\\n\\nThanks to technological advancements, here in the twenty-first century we have instant access to other humans, modern healthcare and even quick transportation. So what happens when those advancements are used in negligent ways that can put other people in danger? Take cell phones, for example. These are devices that modern humans use on a daily basis to communicate with each other. What happens when a cell phone is combined with the use of a car. It can be not only dangerous for the passengers of the cars but other people around the car as well. According to the United States, Highway Traffic Safety Administration Distracted driving involving phones took over three thousand four hundred and fifty lives in 2016 alone. Statistics and research clearly show why people shouldn\\'t use a phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nFirst of all, due to recent legislative laws passed in various states, accidents involving cell phone use have been greatly reduced. Since the evolution of phones, going from corded phones to cordless, to flip phones and touch screen, phone use while driving has become more common with each advancement. Texting and driving became sensationalized in the mid two thousand, which caused bills like House Bill 1965 to be passed in Oklahoma, which made texting while driving illegal in the state. After passing that bill, fatalities in Oklahoma dropped a whopping thirty percent. The law also helped lower injury crashes by twenty-two percent, and it showed a twelve percent overall decrease in car crashes. This data showed the impact that phone use while driving was indeed dangerous. In over forty-seven U.S states, texting and driving are considered illegal. While in over twenty U.S states its completely prohibited to use your phone while driving. These precautions were taken because texting while driving was extremely common, as well as dangerous, and not taken as seriously. The mixture of negligence and convenience caused injuries, fatalities, and crashes.\\n\\nSecondly, cell phone use while driving is recognized as dangerous by many Americans.\\n\\nAccording to an anonymous poll from the United States Highway Traffic Safety Administration ninety-four percent of drivers realize the dangers of texting while driving. But of that ninety-four percent, thirty-five percent admit to still doing it. Many people choose to use modern advancements in a way that places themselves, and others in harm, knowingly. One out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident, compared to drunk driving.\\n\\nPhone use causes a four hundred percent increase in attention off the road, which will most likely result in a crash.\\n\\nMany people would argue that you can\\'t stop people from using phones while driving, here are some ways we can eliminate the use of cellphones while driving. Things like ads, laws and even outside prevention can help stop distracted driving involving phone use. Phone company AT&T launched A campaign to inform consumers about the dangers of using phones while driving. After that campaign \"24.5 million consumers pledged to not to drive distracted on its site, itcanwait. com.\" Stats like that can show us how raising awareness via even everyday ads, can help prevent more tragedies.\\n\\nIn 2017 AT&T launched drive mode, a driving app designed to keep users from using their phones while driving. When the app is turned on, it uses the phones navigation sense to track if the phone is going over twenty-five miles an hour. Once that speed limit is triggered, the app can send out automatic responses to incoming text messages which keep the driver focusing on the road. The app has over 250 million downloads in over one hundred countries. This shows people are willing to take precautions if informed, and given options.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones should not be used in any capacity while driving. Stats show that phone use while driving can cause distractions, which may lead to fatalities. By implementing laws such as house bill 1965 in Oklahoma, we can help prevent distracted driving. Data shows us that by passing laws and using consumer awareness tactics, we can successively decrease phone use while driving. No phones equal fewer distractions which reduce car accidents and preserves our lives.               ',\n",
       " 'Should people be able to use phones while driving?\\n\\nCell phones should not be allowed while driving. Using a phone while driving should not be allowed because they cause car accidents, deaths, and insurance to rise. Studies show that a cell phone can put drivers at a greater risk of a car accident. Even though it still is dangerous, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. People think that it is safe to drive hands free, looking down because they can drive without them. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nPeople who have jobs that depend on phones say that they always have to be available to answer the phone even while they are driving. Because of these habits they can create a dangerous environment for them ad people around them and can cause collisions. Business related jobs can also be stressful ad cause emotional stress that can lead to a bad tragedy. The conversation can possibly cause the person to be upset and can lower their driving ability, which can lead them to losing control over the car. So if people don\\'t make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nPeople driving hands free is also another thing that can be dangerous because they think that they are very skilled drivers who know what they are doing. There are devices that people can be safe, but that is not always the case. Hands-free devices do not take away the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. According to some studies, they show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. That means that people can possibly miss a stop sign, hear a horn or siren, not paying attention to traffic lights, and looking out for their surroundings. This is a huge problems because more and more people can die or be extremely injured from this because some drivers make very poor decisions.\\n\\nPeople say that phones can be useful in emergency situations. While that can be true, there are also some cons behind it. If a person were to get into an accident, they would have trouble finding their phone because they cannot reach it or it is nowhere to be found. People should not rely on their phones especially when it comes to emergency situations. It\\'s not going to always help to use a phone when it is out of sight to where you cannot see it. There are services that people can use to get help through these kinds of situations. In case there is an emergency, you can have the service contacted through a device that is equipped to your car knowing your exact location. This will better your situation more than using your phone.\\n\\nIf people do not change their ways on driving with phones, more and more accidents will happen overtime. Phones are never that important to be on while driving because you can always call or text that person back when you are done driving. There should not be any more accidental deaths of pedestrians or children that want to cross the street and get hit by a person making poor decisions. Any person who is caught texting ad driving should be fined for people their life and others in danger. The world needs to be very aware of this serious situation and make a change.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAuthorLastName, FirstName. Title of the Book Being Referenced. City Name: Name of Publisher, Year.

       " \"Required Essay: Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been. However, attachment to these devices can distract individuals from their surroundings causing a number of problems. Mainly, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle has a great potential to cause accidents. Alternative hands free devices such as bluetooth headsets can keep a driver's eyes on the road while also being able to communicate as necessary.\\n\\nIf a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased. According to The United States Department of Transportation, cellphones are the cause of 1.6 million car crashes per year in the U.S. Driving a car requires a certain amount of focus, coordination, and reflexes in order to drive safely. Humans can only focus on so much at once, so unnecessary operation of a cellular device is highly advised against when doing something as potentially dangerous as driving.\\n\\nHands free accessories are the perfect alternative for people who absolutely need to be communicating while driving. Headsets and bluetooth screens integrated in to some cars are relatively safe compared to blatant texting while driving. While a study done by the University of Utah displays evidence that using these hands free devices can incapacitate a driver even more than alcohol, having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all.\\n\\nWhen driving, the best way to avoid an accident is to not communicate via a cellular device in any way. Laws against using cell phones when driving should remain in place and continue to be enforced. Not only do they put the driver in danger, they put everyone else on the road in danger as well.    \",\n",

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I'll explain why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nToday in the year of 2020 people use their phones on a daily basis because at this point that has become the most important thing in any person's life, I mean I can't say anything I use my phone almost every day, but the one thing I don't do is get on the phone while driving.\\n\\nWell first I want to say that I don't think that it is ok to drive while on the phone it's just not safe, because you could be driving and going to answer the phone at the same time and pull out in to the middle of the four way stop thinking it's your turn to go and get T-boned because you were too busy trying to answer a phone call.\\n\\nThe second reason I don't think you shouldn't be on your phone while driving is because you could be answering a text or watching a video or reading something and that make you distracted from what's around you on the road and it could put you and other people around you in danger, and could get you really hurt some people get hurt so bad they don't recover or they could lose their life.\\n\\nThe third and final reason is because it's the law that you can't be on the phone while on the road you could get pulled over and get a ticket and you could even get your license take from you driving while driving isn't worth your life so what do you want to do answer that text or end up in a body bag.\\n\\nMisiak 2            \",\n",
       " \"PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nCell phone use while driving statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk.\\n\\nTexting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\\n\\nBecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving.\\n\\nParents should also avoid calling their teen when he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving.                         \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nShould people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. So should you use your phones while driving I think not.\\n\\nTexting and driving is one of the most dangerous forms of distracted driving. In fact, the average text sent or read in a car takes a driver's eyes off the road for 5 seconds. This is more than enough time to get in a life-altering accident. Now in the matter of 5 seconds of looking at your phone you can cause yourself to getting in a really bad accident. Now if you get caught texting or using your phone while driving you can get in some trouble. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $25 for a first offense, $50 for a second offense, and $75 for a third offense. The penalty for a first offense for violating the texting law is a fine of $20 to $400 and up to four points on the driving record of the offender. So are you sure you willing to pay the fine or do the time for texting while driving. It really isn't worth it you can wait until you get to your destination. There more things important than your phone while you're driving like the road than an Instagram notification.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving doesn't only put the driver at risk, but also everyone else on the road. Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.\\n\\nThere are many reason on why texting while driving is very useful. Here's seven reasons to stop using your phone and driving it puts innocent lives at risk, it puts your life at risk, it is comparable to, if not worse than, driving under the influence ,you are more likely to crash, it's very easy to simply pull over, you are setting a bad example for children and it is often illegal. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. As long as their use does not distract you from focusing on the road and you do not have to touch the phone. Using your phone when your car is stationary at traffic lights or in congested traffic. Illegal. When the engine is running and you are in control of the car, it is illegal to touch your phone. Now if you were a passenger in a car would you want the driver to be using their phone while driving? No so think when you're driving and you have the urge to look at your phone think of what could happen if you take your eyes of the road or how you would feel if someone on their phone while driving. Please don't text while drive or get on your phone.\\n\\nSo now should people should you use your phone while driving? Think of what could happen while doing such a thing like checking your phone. It isn't worth it at all to look at that notification at all. You can save yourself from getting into an accident. You can save yourself from potentially killing someone for just looking away for 2 seconds. So please don't use your phone while driving please and thank you.\\n\\nCities: Phones & Driving 1. https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html 2. https://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html 3. https://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html 4. https://www. safewise. com/faq/auto-safety/danger-texting-driving/\\n\\n5. https://www. drivinglaws. org/indexhf. php 6. https://www. pantagraph. com/news/opinion/mailbag/texting-while-driving-puts-others-at-risk/article_403288a0-b77c-11de-9bf8-001cc4c002e0. html   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nAlthough phones have a lot of impact in our lives phones are getting better and easier for us to\\n\\nUse. By that I mean technology is getting better with the generation changing and its a lot easier\\n\\nBecause back in the day like in the 1900's there was flip phones coming out and it was a little\\n\\nDifficult to use not by answering a call but by texting or trying to find something on the internet.\\n\\nSo with the phones getting better with the years or technology in general it gets to people trying\\n\\nTo multitask or simply trying to answer a text back, a call, or simply just try to look something\\n\\nUp on the internet. Which comes to being really dangerous when driving and trying to do some\\n\\nOf those things. Which honestly in my opinion you shouldn't really do that and should wait to\\n\\nAnswer the phone or whatever you are trying to find. Or simply just give your phone to someone\\n\\nIf you have someone with you on the passenger side. Because not waiting to use your phone can\\n\\nGet you in trouble and you can also lose your live. By what I mean by that is that if you're\\n\\nDriving and you decide to pick up your phone to just see your social media or a text message and\\n\\nYour eyes are not on the road like they are supposed to be you can run someone over or simply\\n\\nJust move on to the other lane next to you and you crash into another oncoming car or simple\\n\\nJust crash to a pole of a store and if that happens you can lose your life or the other person can.\\n\\nImage if the other person you crashed into has little kids and something bad happens to their kids\\n\\nDo you know how much guilt you would have? Cause I would have so much guilt because it was\\n\\nMy fault the other family is suffering just because I wouldn't wait to see my phone.

       " \"Phones and Driving: Credit Recovery Essay\\n\\nAccidents can be the result of anything from being drunk to being a little tired. Yes, even being too tired behind the wheel can cause an accident. While there are an infinite numbers of ways accidents can be caused, but there is one way that is currently growing in popularity. That way is cell phone use while driving. Cell phones are already known as a possible distraction in most situations, but they have a great impact on the focus of anyone, and if not taken seriously it could have unwanted results. This is a very likely result no matter if they're an experienced driver or someone who is just beginning. The most common ways such accidents happen is by drivers trying to text, make phone calls, or use other applications on their phone while on the road. However, this problem could be solved very easily if drivers today used their smartphones blue tooth ability when possible, and otherwise refrain from using their phones. Cellphones should not be being used while anyone is on the road and driving no matter what\\n\\nThe issue of irresponsible driving by using a cell phone is more common than news stories today make it out to be. In the past it was more thoroughly addressed when cellphones first came out and the issue was new, but now people expect it and have lost any urgency to stop people from using their phones. Many people now think its ok. This is one of the worst things that could happen because the recurrence of these accidents is only grown from then. There are statistics that compare the accident cause rates from then and now. In 2013, a total of 1.2 million crashes occurred, and 341,000 involved text messages. Then in the first six months of 2018 alone a total of 18,770 deaths were recorded from texting and driving accidents. This makes it very clear of how serious this issue can become. No matter how much safer cars get, people must be as alert and focused as they would have to be if they were in the most dangerous car because anything could happen.\\n\\nMost sources, when tackling this issue add the detail that this is just or mainly teenagers that use their phones while driving. This is assumed because of how often teenagers are on their phones a day, but adults use their phones just as often. Of course, extra caution is needed when teenagers drive, but the exclusion of anyone who is not a teenager leaves the possibility of accidents from this to occur just as often. This allows any reckless adult to assume that they are skilled enough when it comes to using their phone while driving. Further research shows that this can and does happen to people of all ages and driving experience.\\n\\nThis way of thinking brings about greater risk for severe accidents. As well as the wrong influence on teens that are learning and planning to drive. If people don't take the initiative to make sure them and their loved ones are being safe on the road, then anything that the government does will have no effect.\\n\\nAlthough they're not as effective as hoped, many stats in the United States have established laws that will fine anyone who is seen using their cell phone and driving. Texting and driving is very much illegal today, but there is still a lot of accidents that occur. Most importantly, laws like this have little to no effect on whether the person fined will try and or do it again in the future. The government is taking more precaution for our safety. So why has it proven to be so difficult to take responsibility of our own safety.\\n\\nThe simple fact is that texting and driving is problem that should not exist. There are so many ways such accidents could have been prevented. Such as a using Bluetooth device, having the passenger text for you, and of course, just flat out not using a phone while driving at all. In addition to just those few ways there is a growing number of preventatives as technology progresses. With that being said, the first step is taking self-responsibility, and it starts with each specific individual.            \",\n",

People use their phone for just about anything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, and internet sulfuring and etc. Sometimes we can do two of these things at the same time unfortunately, people are choosing the wrong times using their cell phones while they are driving. As a society we have to become more focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Every day in the United States one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and a lot are injured in some way in crashed, by these irresponsible, distracted drivers. Most of the dangerous distracting activities that many people do is texting while driving. It's extremely dangerous because people who are doing this is putting more attention in texting, she/he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. Driving requires a lot of focus and full attention. Distracted driving affects all drivers from time to time but can come with stiff consequences. Unfocused or distracted driving does not affect all drivers the same. Any task that takes your attention away from the road is a distraction. These include crying or fighting kids in the back seat, talking on the phone, eating lunch, and much more. Unfortunately, it is common for people to multitask while driving.\\n\\nHowever, any distraction (eating with one hand and driving with another, looking away to grab a fallen object, spilling a beverage, etc.) which causes you to not devote full attention to driving can cause accidents. Banning cellphone usage is a law that has come about because of the high level of distraction from the devices and the number of people using them. Some states ban all usage while others ban only texting. Most people think that nothing will ever happen to them until, one day, it does. It only takes a split second of distraction to create a lifetime of pain and suffering. Remember, driving is a privilege and your decisions do not only affect you but other people on the road too. Last year a mother of 4 lost all her kids in a car crash 3 died at the scene of the wreck and the other one died at the hospital the mother wasn't paying attention because she tried to answer a call from her friend and her phone felled out here hand and she was searching for it while her eye was off the road and when she finally found she couldn't stop in time and she crash into another car it's very important to keep your eyes on the road because it can cause a lot of damage or even worse.    \",\n",

With this era it's rare not to see someone constantly checking their notification even in the most parcul ior area. Even with smartphones having this high tech specs making everyday life simple, many people fear that smartphones are taking over lifes and endangering the health of the people. A prime example is whether or not drivers should be using smartphones while operating a vehicle?\\n\\nThere are those who believe its common sense to not turn on a phone while driving and there are those who say phone make commutes easier for them. Should drivers not look through their phones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nSmart Devices has made the daily life of people's simple from making calculation to having video chat with friends or family. This is where many people spend their time looking at post and trying to get likes for their pictures. We even seen videos of other not looking were their going and bumping into poles or even getting hit by drivers. But getting distracted by just a simple whistle from a phone has created a blur line between on looking at that notification or keeping a stable mind. Walking while texting is a problem, but texting while driving has became a national issue where many states are trying to combat this issue, even average citizens are raising awareness to this problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or NHTSA has stated that texting while driving has risen over the past decade as more incidents are revealed that the driver were on his/her phone before the accident. Even with a decrease in accident by 2 percent in late 2017 the NHTSA has confirmed that 73% of accidents are due to distracted drivers. This caught the attention of States realising that the number of accidents are rising leading them to take measures to prevent more fatal accident. A prime example is Georgia as they became one of 16 states to ban phones while operating a vehicle. This comes as many news outlet and even will known news station reported of a fatal accident in Georgia where three college student lost their life in a fatal car accident. The reason this became a national news was what happen before the accident which lead to lives being lost. What happen was the result of a poor decision made by the driver who ultimately ended the life of three friends. What this drive did was selfish and irresponsible as the driver before the accident was going top speed of over 100 mph and on their phone.\\n\\nWhy they did this was a result of wanting to have a good Snap for the most popular app Snapchat so friends can watch. What comes after was tragic, leading to Georgia to place House Bill 673 or The Hands-Free Georgia Act that became effect in July 1, 2018. But why has distracted drivers risen over the past decade even if they know the consequences that comes with it.\\n\\nStudies from universities revealed that looking at your phone has become an addiction for so many, it has ever beaten people who use illegal substance and smokers.\\n\\nCalifornia State University tested on why people are addicted to smartphones by creating a little experiment. This experiment was sending countless messages to a volunteer, but the catch was to place the phone out of reach of the volunteer. What they found was a spike in the heart and the breathing pattern changing. They keep on changing by each notification that was being sent. In this case, the anxiety was caused by withdrawal from an addiction. Why do people get addicted will it's this substance called dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical within the brain that gives use this happy feeling when we hear that notification ringing in our pocket. This is why people are addicted to their phones because they don't realize that the ring of a phone activates the Dopamine. No matter how hard a person tries to not look through their phone the brain gives of this anxiety of not knowing what will happen if they don't look. Why do people value their phones more than others is a good question.\\n\\nThis is where it come to play when discussing whether or not drivers should be using their phones while driving. Even with states placing laws to prevent accidents from occurring, this hasn't stopped those few from looking through his/her phone will on the road. Will all been part of this looking through your phone waiting for that special someone to text back. But is it possible to stop drivers from checking their phone completely, will this is based on the moral of those who feel like that text is more important than human lifes. No matter how hard official warn about the dangers of texting, they ultimately fall into deaf ears or those who believe this will never happen to them. The only way phone driving accident will decreases is by having people recognize what they are doing, because even with laws put in place it fall into people hands in whether they will obey or fall into their selfish needs.                     \",\n",

Any use of the phone while driving is not only risking your life but also the other person who you possibly hit. Some may say it's not a big problem using your phone while operating a vehicle because they do it all the time. Operating a phone while driving can cause fatal injuries and should not be performed.\\n\\nTexting and driving is closer for you to get into a car accident. It may cause damage to oneself that oneself may never overcome. Most car accidents are of teens who stay on their phone and don't realize that they are in the wrong lane and don't see an upcoming vehicle. Being that irresponsible can cause traumatic events. If one is distracted by their phone and a car is swerving down the lane because they lost control of the wheel it may cause them to hit one another and one is going to regret it because they could've prevented it from happening.\\n\\nHaving performed this act can cause fatal results. One can die just because they wanted to see who texted or called, but as a result it lead to death. Imagine losing someone because they were on their phone, you would be heart broken. Many have horror stories to tell about them using their phone while driving and can say that it's a bad habit that everyone who does the same should get out of.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell phones are a distraction to the entire society today. A distracted driver using their cell phone is one of the most prominent reasons for car accidents. People should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Cell phones are a distraction and when being used while driving, could result in a car accident that might be fatal or in the least, cause serious injury to you or another innocent person.\\n\\nWhen driving a car, the biggest distraction is a cell phone that is turned on and ready to receive calls and text messages. Even cell phone providers are moving towards advancements with applications that assist drivers to ignore their phones or mute them until the vehicle is not operational. Some states are passing laws that require drivers to place their cell phones in an area out of reach to the driver.\\n\\nSeveral accidents and even fatalities have happened because of distracted drivers.\\n\\nThe driver might take their eyes off the road for a split second, and then return their eyes to the roadway and have no clue if they stopped at a stop sign or ran through a red light. When a driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text or find a phone number to make a call, the driver has just put their life and other lives into serious danger. Life as they know it can dramatically change with that one quick glance away from the road.\\n\\nNo person wants to live the rest of their life carrying the guilty burden and consequences of making a stupid decision; however, people do it every day.\\n\\nSome distracted drivers are sitting in jail right now, with serious legal trouble, insurmountable debt for attorneys, and an unimaginable feeling of guilt because they made the decision to look away and either killed someone else or seriously injured someone. That life changing moment will haunt them for the rest of their life. Assuredly, they all wished they had that quick second or two back to not let the cell phone distract them.\\n\\nMany people, for many years, traveled around the world with no cell phone or GPS, no Siri or Alexa to guide them, and certainly no distractions from text messaging or gaming opportunities. A distracted driver can be the cause of physical harm or even death to oneself or others. Why is it such a hard thing to put your phone down while driving? I am glad the state of Georgia passed the \"Hands Free\" or \"Distracted Driver\" law that states no cell phones should be touched by the driver of a vehicle. Too many people die every year because of distracted drivers that were either texting or talking while driving a vehicle. A loss of life is the most horrific experience any family member will deal with and most definitely the most senseless reason for a family to lose a loved one. Picture your parents answering the door to a police officer and the officer telling them you have been involved in a car wreck... it\\'s the absolute worst nightmare for any parent. A cell phone, a message, a phone call - none of these are as important as a living, breathing human life. Please be a safe driver and put your cell phone away while driving.\\n\\nPROPER_NAME       ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nThe use of cellular phones has spread like wildfire in the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many American citizens, and a good number of people depend on them to carry out daily operations. Unfortunately, many of these daily operations occur while the individual is driving. As a result, many accidents have taken place in the last ten years due to the use of cellular phones while on the road.\\n\\nThis leads me to believe that if people can't concentrate on the road while talking on a cell phone, they shouldn't talk at all while driving. Rather than restricting access, the goal should be to provide in-vehicle information systems and safer means of using your cellular phone while driving. I understand that restricting cell phone usage while driving altogether isn't the best means for solving the problem.\\n\\nI do, however, believe that more safety precautions need to be taken for individuals who will be talking on their phones while driving. Phones are being created by Erricson, Motorolla, and Nokia today in which offer a hands-free cell phone so that you can keep both hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Some of these come in the form of headsets and give the user a voice-activated sequence, which allows you to talk into the speaker, and the number will instantly be dialed. Already this has eliminated the chance of your hands being off the wheel and having to do the act of dialing the phone. Both which allow you to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\\n\\nEven hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.\\n\\nWhatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.         \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Cars: The Dream (Nightmare) Team\\n\\nConsidering that these essays are graded by staff workers who aren't paid enough, I'd think it's fair to say that the reader of this is a driver. Whether you go buy car, bike, bus, etc. it's still driving, and driving should never be combined with texting or phone calling. Using the phone while driving is never safe, neither to yourself nor others.\\n\\nOne key point is that you become distracted. Becoming distracted can cause danger to yourself or others, as you are piloting a giant steel box. Going offroad could hurt yourself. You could also accidentally smash into other cars.\\n\\nYou could also use your phone's bluetooth to stream music to your car's radio. However, since you're only listening to music that you already like, there's a good chance that you might get too into the music and get distracted. This could also cause you to run off the road and potentially hurt yourself and others.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones can be a dangerous and evil device that can cause harm to you or other drivers while you are on the road. Because of this, you should always put away your phone once you begin driving. Throw it into the back seat or put it in the glove box.   \",\n",
       " 'The Dangers of Cellphone Usage While Driving\\n\\nOperating a cell phone or any type of device while driving comes with many risks. Many don\\'t see the consequences that it may bring and use it anyway. Studies have proven that most car accidents are due to use of a device while driving. Many may believe it\\'s not that serious but in reality it is. Therefore, should operating a device while driving be banned?\\n\\nTo continue, using a mobile device while driving increases the risks of a car accident.\\n\\nStephen Corby has an article, \"Why you really shouldn\\'t use your mobile phone while driving\" here, he compares the usage of a mobile device while driving to driving with your eyes closed or reading a book while driving. \"Frankly, using mobile phone while driving, is such a stupid cause of death that, before the advent of the cell phone it would only have been comparable with reading a book while driving or closed eyes while driving.\" Corby makes a pretty great comparison here. The amount of time you take to pick up your device and see who is calling you or texting you is enough time to get off the lane. While driving you should have full attention on the road. Although it is tempting to use your device try considering a longer life for yourself or someone else on the road.\\n\\nFurthermore, driving requires one\\'s full attention. Most of the time accidents aren\\'t caused by one but instead someone else on the road. One could be perfectly driving and paying full attention but then another one can come maybe drunk or using a phone and come crash into the other. In scenes like these is where maybe if you weren\\'t on your device you could\\'ve seen the other coming. In many occasions this has been the cause of accidents. Using a mobile device behind the wheel just takes your attention off the road even if it may be for seconds. One should always have their full attention on the road. It\\'s more likely to prevent accidents from happening if your full attention is on the road and not on what is happening in your phone.\\n\\nTherefore, the usage of a mobile device while driving is prohibited now.\\n\\n\"HANDS FREE LAW\" is the law passed by our recent governor Nathan Deal. The law has been taking place since July of 2018. HFL prohibits a driver from occupying a phone behind the wheel. The driver must not have a phone in their hand or any part of their body to support their phone. A driver can not send messages nor read them. A drive can not watch a video or record a video while driving. There are exceptions into using a phone but those are only when reporting a crash, or another emergency. The law does not apply when the driver is parked. Breaking the law can cause one to have consequences such as a fine of $50 for the first time, $100 for the second, and\\n\\n$150 for the third, each time points get taken away from your license which could reach the point where your license will be suspended.\\n\\nIn conclusion, being distracted while driving can cause fatal crashes or other consequences. There are a series of reasons why one might pick up a device behind the wheel and to think to themselves it could be an emergency but even that split second of attention into the device can become a lethal end based on one decision and curiosity. It\\'s better to avoid and prevent something bad from happening than to continue to test it until it does. Usage of a mobile device while driving should not be allowed. And as stated in the 4th paragraph it is prohibited, it is a law. Let\\'s set full attention on the road and be the smart drivers.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAnderson, Peter, et al. \"Why You Really Shouldn\\'t Use Your Mobile Phone While Driving.\" CarsGuide, www. carsguide. com. au/car-advice/why-you-really-shouldnt-use-your-mobile-phone-while- driving-33062.

       " 'PHONES & DRIVING\\n\\nI have heard so many stories and lectures about being on your electronic devices while driving. Using electronic devices while driving your vehicle is not great at all. Cell phones are just a distraction that tends to keep your mind off the road and focused on the phone. Distractions while driving can lead to injuries and/or death. I remember when my father first bought me a cell phone; I could not keep my eyes or hands off of it. It became a total distraction for me. Three Main Reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving is because, such behavior can cause casualties, inflict pain upon families, and leave the driver with guilt.\\n\\nFirst, causing and/or having casualties in families are not great. Having death causes pain, sorrow, and many burdens that people have on their shoulders to deal with. Hearing about another family member in your family being passed away, is not a good feeling. Almost 1.3 million people die due to being on their electronic devices while driving their vehicle. An electronic device is really not necessary while driving. In addition, using cell phones while driving is unsafe; therefore let\\'s try to prevent many casualties as we can.\\n\\nAnother reason why citizen\\'s use should not use cell phones while driving is because; the person driving the vehicle may inflict pain on their families. With that being said, the family members of the deceased family will be hurt, because death leaves a void. Likewise, the family member of the driver who caused the accident will be hurt as well, because they would not want their loved one incarcerated. Although nothing replaces a life; however, violators should be disciplined for their actions.\\n\\nFinally, a person using cell phones while driving can end up having to live with guilt upon them. What can they do? What can do they say? The words \"I am sorry\", does not change a bad occurrence. It can be really difficult living with guilt. For example, I have a friend who killed a dog and after the incident happen she felt astonished by what she had done. Her family was hurt by what she had done to another family\\'s pet, and the dog\\'s family was upset because it was their guard dog and home protector. After all of the commotion was over, she had said she really felt bad about the situation. When you do something wrong, you cannot always apologize for your wrong doings. When you try to talk to their families, they will not always listen. The result for you is dealing with guilt for the rest of your life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using cellular devices while driving has become more of a negative influence. More and more people having started using their phones while driving. Although these kinds of actions can cause casualties, influential pain, and having to live with guilt, the citizen willing to not use their cellular device while driving, can prevent all of this from having.

       " \"Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during the next two decades. Cell phones make it easy to contact during an emergency even during driving although using cell phones while driving is dangerous. Several researches have proved that using cell phones during driving make driver more exposed to fatal accidents.\\n\\nCell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fall to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. The main advantage to avoid using cell phones during driving in ensuring the safety of driving , vehicle, and other people driving on the road. By making conversation , writing messages or just playing with the mobile increases the chances of accidents.\\n\\nAs a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create.\\n\\nCell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.\\n\\nAlthough, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones while driving it is pertinent, for the sake of argument, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenarios such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route.   \",\n",
       " \"According to the official DMV website, in 2014 26 % of all car crashes involved cell phone use. Considering all the other factors that can cause accidents this is a large percentage. There are so many distractions and uncertainties on the roads, there is no need to add another one to hinder your driving ability. Just looking away for a second could make you lose precious reaction time. The complete removal of the use of cell phones while operating would make the roads a lot safer.\\n\\nMore and more people are getting on the roads making it more imperative that we practice safe driving habits. 481,000 people are using cell phones while driving. Cell phones contribute to distracted driving. It can be considered one or all three types of distraction: Visual- which is removing eyes from the road, Manual- removing hands from the wheel, and Cognitive-removing your attention or focus from driving. Any of these can lead to catastrophic consequences to you or any passengers in the vehicle. This is why those with stands or hands-free are not a solution but a lie to see as if it's better. Most people don't drive with both hands once they are comfortable driving. Teens who have little experience and high cell phone use create double the danger.\\n\\nWhile people with high experience may think they are exempt but they are still human. The average reaction time to visual stimulus is 0.25 sec. Drivers spend so much more than that looking at their phones by the time they realize what's happening it will be too late. To prevent this there are several alternatives one could do if it is necessary to use their phone. You should finish call or text conversations before driving. So you're not constantly checking the map make sure you know you location and how to get their b efore getting in. Even if you haven't finished a conversation just set your phone to do not disturbed so your not slightly distracted.\\n\\nCell phones are a great advancement in technology and make our live a lot easier, just not while doing 60 on the highway. The creation of handsfree make it easier to use your phone not safer. The inclusion of these in the attack of phone use in vehicles is step to safer roads. They should't be use in cars and need to be more heavily pressed upon before its too late.   \",\n",
       " 'Texting while Driving\\n\\nTexting while driving can be a distraction from the road just by looking away for two seconds .\\n\\nDriving is in need of all the attention on the road.\\n\\nJust one mistake can cause a fatal crash on both parties. Drivers should not text and drive.\\n\\nYou will be tempted to want to pick up your phone especially if you\\'re a new driver such as teenagers. For Example , \" There are reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes a year.\" says the The National Safety Council. Another Example , \" Texting While driving causes 400 percent time of your eyes off the road. \" (Edger Snyder and Associates ) . Each year more that 1 million people die over texting and driving but the support of those who ban the right to text and drive is in the 94 percentile.\\n\\nTeenage driving can be critical even for the parents. As teens are excited to have freedom to drive wherever they want they tend to be distracted just by looking at directions to a map.\\n\\nFor example, \"Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone.\" ( Edger Snyder and Associates)\\n\\nmeaning the inexperienced drivers tend to feel like they can multitask better than adults but turns out not to be true . In 2017 \" 15, 341 drivers aged 15 -19 were involved in fatal accidents due to distractions off the road\"\\n\\nsays cellphone and driving statistics .\\n\\n\"Nearly 48% of drivers admit to using their phones while driving .\"\\n\\nsays a National survey on distracted driving attitudes and behaviors report in 2012.\\n\\nMeaning drivers know how at risk their life including others are against and still continue to do so. \"In 2018 48 states banned texting and driving,\" says Issac and Issac after the excessive rate of fatal deaths in the previous year .\\n\\nIn Conclusion ,\\n\\nTexting and Driving can never be a good thing no matter what the emergency might look on screen.\\n\\nYour life is not worth losing over and small text that could\\'ve waited.\\n\\nEach year the numbers rise of accidental deaths caused by distraction of the driver.

       " \"Phones & driving\\n\\nI strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many. So we really should not be driving with phone\\n\\nDriving with phone cause more accident studies proves that also drunk driving One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective and it sad because people are dying because someone else action the innocence always gotta to suffer because of someone else's mistakes and the facts that they were on the phone sop someone might be dead or in icu because of the driver who was on the phone chit chatting. Cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk Anyhow cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action. Besides all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light. however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In reality talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us. That why ur so many accidents and people don't notice that.\\n\\nDriving require our attention and we don't give it that much because our phone get all of it mobile phone use is dangerous but common because it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash Drivers' use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. Most importantly people should not use cell phones while driving. Importanly that kind of being incoredinte by other because if you want to be on the phone and while you drivng and alsmost kill yourself that doesn't mean you have jeopardized other life because you ready to end your by being on the phone it really fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. Besides using your phone while driving is really stupid because that how you can really died and that a stupid way to died cause of a phone or kill other and by other i mean motorcycle driver, a pedestrian walking across the street and or someone braking suddenly in front of you last minute because you wasn't paying attention to the road you can also get serious and bad injury from accident you should not use the phone while driving because it can cause you your life and other and it also an distraction to the road because of cell phones use you can cause inattention blindness while driving you are putting yourself and others around you in danger and placing a ban on cell phone use. while driving is proven to be effective. Did you know that distracted driving comes in three forms? When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second.\\n\\nFive seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting when traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field blindfolded Many people don't realize how risky texting and driving or talking on their cell phone and driving can be cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk. To begin with, cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action first of all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours. Sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone, and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In addition, talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us a lot of people even innocent people as well have had accidents involving one of those. Out of the three there has been one that has become more common, and it's only increasing if people don't put a stop to it themselves a usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or writing a simple text messages No text is worth dying for as technology keeps on evolving quickly you'd wonder it really worth my life or a text or simply just picking up my phone.\\n\\nSome accidents are common while driving they can either be minor or a major accident that can possibly result in people not making it or many car accidents have gone to notice is because of small piece of technology we always carry around, which is our cell phones. Studies have shown a major increase in simple or huge accidents because of lack of attention on the road while driving That is because of the following, people using their cell phones Banning this should take place because of the accident can lead to something worse than just a small injury while driving your phone should be kept in a place you won't hear or see it deaths have been noticed because of the simple fact that drivers tend to pay more attention to their phone instead of the road Banning on the use of phones should be enforced this has affected many innocent people with losing their life because of a driver not paying attention. But it also has some good into using cell phones or even having one while driving benefits of cell phone while driving along is that you can use your phone to call roadside emergencies, car trouble, obtain personal information, or even navigation; however, it may lead to running red lights, drifting across lanes, or worse, causing accidents phones can do so many things, but most importantly they allow you to connect to emergency service its mot needed during roadside emergencies such as ambulance, police and firefighters. Studies have shown that the use of cell phones in emergency situations, such as calling for an ambulance, has improved its mortality rates having access to a cell phone is very important when it comes down to getting important information to that certain individual and when information needs to be passed to that individual as soon as possible. The most important part of having a cell phone is navigation cell phones allow users to call for direction when they cannot find their destinations.\\n\\nIn conclusion it pros and cons when using cell phones you have to use it for the right reasons and not to chit chat while on the highway or even on the road where you can cause other people their life and even people who are or even pedestrian walker because they also sometimes get killed because the car curved on the sidewalk it more than just your life that you protecting it other also everybody life matter.    \",\n",
       " 'Should drivers be able to use their phones while driving? GPS, Instagram, Facebook, in other words distractions shouldn\\'t be allowed while operating a 2 ton vehicle capable of killing someone and yourself within seconds. With a split second decision you could be dead or responsible for a death for a text message or a video or post something that would\\'ve been there later on.\\n\\nDid you know texting and driving is one of the leading causes of vehicle deaths. With just a slight 2 second check of a message can cause you to be in prisoned for vehicular homicide causing you not to be able to text, talk, and touch to that person as much as you want. You could your freedom behind it. Your Family could lose they child, cousin, sister, brother, niece or nephew behind a simple \"ok\". You could be preparing your family for a funeral or a court date. A casket or a cell. A T shirt or a Suit. Worse than that you could possible deal with the conscious of killing someone. 3,287 deaths because of distracted driving in 2018.\\n\\nWhat apps are included in these \"distractions\"? Should GPS count? GPS should count for 2 reason. While GPS has been very beneficial in the 20 century however in GPS requires attention of the driver. For instance the driver the driver missed what the GPS says and pick up the phone to check to see where to turn now while a minority of drivers have a type of device to hold their phone up near the face to be able to see without looking down but a majority of driver use there cup holder and with that they have to bring they attention off the road for a certain amount of time. Although that\\'s that one driver issue it only takes one domino to knock the whole thing down meaning It can cause the whole street to be endangered. Also with GPS drivers tend to pull risky and immature decision to make a correction after missing a turn cause the proper procedures to not be follow and having other drivers confused which can cause a crash and more.\\n\\nWhile driving do you ever think you\\'re responsible for the whole car? The operator of the vehicle is responsible for everybody inside the vehicle. For instance god forbid (2x knocks on wood) say your operating a vehicle a with a family member you care for inside and you went to check a message for 0.9 second within that time you are partially over the on the express way you are struck by a tractor trailer on the right side cause your car to roll multiple times. Your roof in pounded inside and your family member is hurt traumatically. Now you\\'re put in a situation you can\\'t control because you made a decision you could\\'ve controlled. Would you be ok with being the murder of a loved one?\\n\\nWhat about in case of an emergency? In case of an emergency you should have your destination set before driving and If not you should pull up to see how you should address the situation and in case you need to make a phone you should have a passenger assist and if there isn\\'t one then pull along the shoulder and call who is needed while operating the car speaker could be an important sources or reliable resource.\\n\\nIn conclusion, use technology while driving isn\\'t safe. I don\\'t think it should be a thing. With the new technology in the 20century it will be possible to make calls text people back without even touching your phone just based off the development of technology. When you drive , drive safe for your family and for all that care about you and for safety of the other drivers.            ',\n",

With these new features on smartphones people are more prone to using their phones while driving causing a higher risk of death and accidents.\\n\\nEveryday someone is involved in a car accident because they were on there phone, texting while driving is the leading cause of death. There was a 7 year old boy named Xzavier Davis - Bilbo who was crossing the street and he was hit by a car and not only was he hit but the car dragged him 20 feet . The driver was texting on the phone when she hit 7 year old Xzavier . He spent months in the ICU and he is now paralyzed because of this. When people text and drive they put everybody around them in danger not just the people in the car with them.\\n\\nIn conclusion phones are a very distracting factor when driving and dangerous. Anything such as a hands-free device still shouldn\\'t be allowed because it is still a distraction. These problems are injuring and killing people. People should not text and drive.                                                              ',\n",
       " \"Today ¸ drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Why ? Because too many accidents are happening causing people people to lose their loved ones and important people in their life. Another reason is because it is a law now and you shouldn't be breaking the law. Then it causes a lack of driving skills.\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accident because they use cell phones. Over the past couple of years, over 1.5 million people have lost their life or loved one's due to people being on their phones while driving. Being on your phone while driving is so dangerous because you can hit somebody and cause a bad wreck possibly killing somebody, putting them in the hospital, making them paralyzed , and not just that, but losing your car. People should not use cell phones while driving because a person could be having a conversation, they might get upset, and it could cause the driver to lose control of the car.\\n\\nPeople should not use cell phones while driving because it's a law you shouldn't want to break. If you are caught breaking the law of no cell phones while driving, it could result in bad consequences. Consequences like getting your license suspended, and not being able to drive until further notice. Also, you might get a ticket or taken to jail and that's something you don't want. If it's something so important that you have to check your phone, you should pull over or wait until you get to where you are going. They have invented a phone dock were you sit your phone while driving and I still think it's unsafe because people are still attempting to still use their phones while driving.\\n\\nPeople who are usually using phones while driving seem to have lack of driving skills which causes the car to go off the road, maybe get too close to another car, and can end up in the lane next to them. Lack of driving skills is the biggest thing that most people have today. Using phones can cause drives to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the road. This appears to have the biggest impact on a lot of drivers that use their phones while driving.\\n\\nPeople shouldn't use phones while driving. It would stop a lot pf car accidents, tickets, death lack of driving skills etc. If drivers put their phones down while driving this would save a lot of lives been taking due to car accidents. If people don't give up cell phones while driving, the number of fatalities on the road will increase each year. With all this being said,\\n\\nI don't think it safe to use your phone while operating a vehicle.                               \",\n",
       " 'Should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?\\n\\nFor a while now since the early 2000s cell phones/smartphones has been a technological rise in the use of its kind. People use them daily for things like social media, internet surfing, reading, planning, alarms and more. There are many ways that the handheld \"easy to use\" technology can help people, but they also can be dangerous to us in many ways if we don\\'t take fully responsibility in them and use them when we need them and when we don\\'t. This leads to the harm of people who think they can be using their phones while they are driving.\\n\\nDriving can be at times boring but using something to distract you from the focus of your own safety on the road isn\\'t a good choice. They are plenty of reason why using cell phones while driving is bad. The most brutal things can happen while you\\'re looking away just for a second. In my opinion the most brutal things that can happen while you\\'re distracting yourself from driving is you killing yourself or someone else. The worst part about it is that you\\'ll always remember what you\\'ve done just by your careless actions.\\n\\nMost people would say it\\'s not as dangerous or that if you\\'re good at it then you can use your phone while you drive. That\\'s not true at all because driving takes in a lot of focus and concentration in order to be a successful driver. Also, when you ARE driving you really must drive for yourself and everyone else because even though you\\'re paying attention it doesn\\'t mean everyone else is. It takes more than just the push of a pedal and the turn of a wheel. In my opinion while you\\'re driving you should be at your most caution due to the risk and the things that could happen to you and anyone else.\\n\\nDaily people end up either dead or injured badly due to the simple fact of a device that they should have mot being paying attention to. Since the handheld device has been put out it has caused thousands of deaths each year. In 2014 cell phones caused over 26 percent of the car incidents in the U.S. last year there where 1.5 million car incidents due to cell phones being involvement while driving. And of those incidents 58% of the drivers were teens. The rate of incident is increasing annually making driving even more difficult and complex then it already is.\\n\\nSo, the best thing to do is to just not handle a phone in anyway when you\\'re driving. There are enough incidents already worldwide due to cell phone being a distraction for drivers. If you have an urge to pick up a phone or get texts or calls often while you\\'re driving it\\'ll be safer to just turn your phone off until you\\'re in a safe position where you can handle it without any risk. Driving is something that should be done with seriousness and not to be tempted with. The roads would be safer and people would be safer if they start turning their phones off for a better solution to deaths by car crashes.\\n\\nShould drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle                                 ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn my honest opinion about phone's and driving they do not go together at because both you have to use full attention on when using especially with how things are now and days. It's really dangerous when doing it driving a car because cars are this big built mobile that if you get into a crash and risk your life and or money for insurance on it. Now I think you could balance it between Phone and driving if your good at that like at a red light maybe take a quick glance and it see what it is and then back to driving or get a car that can pick up phone calls.\\n\\nNow with phones people are so attracted to phones now they can't even walk straight without bumping into people now is it bad to use phones no I don't think it is but when driving is a different story you are putting your life a risk with using a phone. You are putting other peoples life's at risk with doing that too.\\n\\nWhen it comes to cars you need your full attention when driving a car everything needs to be sharp because there is dangerous things everywhere so you need to be aware of that when driving so that nothing bad happens. You can't do that when you're on a phone because you're taking away your senses from driving.\\n\\nI don't think it is a good idea at all to do it unless you know what you're doing and have a car that can pick up phone calls and does not take your time away from driving on the road and therefore can keep you safe and everyone else around and get to your destination safely.        \",\n",

Driving with a cellular device under the age of 18 while driving is strictly prohibited. Driving is a more taxing experience than most realize. It is a death sentence if not taken seriously. Nearly 1.6 million crashes happen annually to texting and driving. This is due to the driver taking his/her attention of the road and not being aware of their surroundings. There should be not lenience when it comes to texting and driving and should be promoted not be a social norm.\\n\\nTexting and driving is not a smart way to drive.

Distracted drivers are the main concern for pedestrians crossing the road. Approximately four thousand people were killed in the year 2015 due to drivers not looking at the road. Having a phone in the car with you is very important but only for emergencies. Now phones are used to text, play music on their phone,make phone calls,etc. Using a phone while driving is a safety hazard and should be punishable by a huge fine or even imprisonment. Vehicular homicide is a real thing and affects thousands of Americans each year. According to the department of transportation in 2018 3,477 died due to texting on the road.\\n\\nFurthermore. the people being hit are not the only ones in danger when drivers use cell phones on the road. Drivers are killed because of their own negligence. On many occasions distracted drivers will hit trees,buildings,homes,etc. When drivers hit massive objects they cause more problems than expected. Drivers who use cell phones while driving can create thousands of dollars worth of damage,and could possibly ruin small businesses. All of this can be averted if only people stop putting their cell phone as a first priority. Let's stop trying to multitask. Any conversation worth risking our lives for is one not worth taking/\\n\\nThirdly, let's think about the children. Children lose everything when someone they lose is gone. Distracted drivers are a growing breed and majority of them are on cell phones. When a driver hits a woman with their car a full sequence of events follow that.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can\\'t put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. One such reason is that.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph.\" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro the minivan full of kids.\" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person\\'s life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody.\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don\\'t make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nHowever, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can\\'t find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn\\'t fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. Concluding, if people don\\'t give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.

Every day one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and around 1000 people are injured in some way in crashes by these irresponsible distracted drivers. One of the most dangerous activities that many people do is texting while driving. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the vehicle and could cause a crash, or even worse, could kill other people. When a person is texting she or he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. This is very dangerous, because it could make the driver lose control of the car and slow her or his brain's reaction time in case of a potential accident.\\n\\nOne of the dangers of texting and driving at the same time is the attention it takes away from the road. A driver who is focused on looking at their phone is not paying enough attention to other cars or what is happening around them. Something as simple as an animal running out in front of their car can cause serious damage to the vehicle and cause the driver to swerve and potentially hit another car. Texting while driving is the act of composing, sending, or reading text messages, email, or making other similar use of the internet on a mobile device while operating. Just by looking on your phone you can easily get yourself killed or kill someone without paying attention.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is very important that we find some ideas to break off this bad habit of texting while driving. I think that one of the easiest and best ways to break this habit is simply to turn off your phone. In this case the driver wouldn't be distracted by the ringing of the phone and it wouldn't make the driver to text while driving. Another way to break this habit is to download some of the new applications that can disable cell phones while people are driving. Also, there are other applications that automatically send a text to whoever is texting the driver to tell that person that she or he is driving, and that the text will be answered later. There are a great variety of applications to choose I think that we can use these to help us with the problem of texting while we are driving so that you as the driver will not get hurt.\\n\\nSomething as important as your own life is more important than your own cell phone. People all over the world need to realize how much danger they are putting other people in when they pick up that phone. It is not just other people you are putting in danger, but also yourself. If for one second you paid more attention to the road then you probably wouldn't be in a situation where you're severely injured or possible killing someone. There should be a law for your phone being out while you are driving because this problem will possibly never stop and will continue harming innocents around the world.                    \",\n",

If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be.\\n\\nDespite offering huge benefits, cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important? The text message or your life?                      \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nHave you ever called someone while they are driving? If you have then, do you care about that person's life? Because if so then you shouldn't do it or hang up the phone because that will put that person you are on the phone with is in danger. This makes the driver focus on the call or texting someone back instead of focusing on the road and other drivers that could run into them and hurt them. Do you know what texting and driving can do to your life? There are also ways to prevent texting and driving. And there are people this has effected a lot of people's lives.\\n\\nTexting and driving is a major danger to your life. If someone is texting and driving and or talking on the phone that means they are not focused on the road or not focused on the other drivers that could possibly merge over and wreck the driver and possibly kill the person. This is a major problem because everyone has the urge to check their phone if they hear it go off with a text ding because everyone think that all calls are possibly an emergency but either that emergency or your life. There are many ways to prevent this.\\n\\nYou can prevent texting and driving many ways. One way to prevent texting and driving is to put your phone on silent or turn it off while driving in a vehicle. That will take the urge of texting someone back or answering a phone call until you get to your destination. If everyone done this when they got in the driver seat of a vehicle there would be less death my car because that is a hug percentage of the reason vehicular accidents happen behind drunk driving. And that effects people's life not just the person involved but the family.\\n\\nThis effect a lot of people's life when someone uses a cellphone when they drive because mostly every time they end up in a car wreck. This can affect the driver or passengers in the car because there are cases where people get paralyzed or brain damage or even worse die in car accidents. That can ruin the rest of their life plan. This can also ruin some families lives by having to care for you while you can't for yourself or sometimes the death case they must deal with you not being there the rest of their life. That's why people should not use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nIn my opinion Cell phones and driving is not ok. They can really ruin someone's life and people can also stop this by using some tips and not using it at all while driving. And this can hurt your life and anyone around you or that knows you. Please don't use a phone and drive I have people I care about on the roads and someone that uses a phone and drives can hurt them on the road and I love them and don't want something to happen to them because someone couldn't put down their phone.             \",\n",
       " 'TEXTING AND DRIVING\\n\\n\"In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you\", said by the mother of a texting while driving victim. The majority of people today use a smart phone on a daily basis. While cellphones have their pros and cons, there is one controversial issue that seems to triumph over the rest, and that is using a cell phone while driving. Operating a cell phone while driving can be extremely hazardous. By following the law and removing phones from behind the wheel, we can eliminate a monumental amount of deaths worldwide.\\n\\nWhile some people really can multitask with a phone while operating a vehicle, everyone is not capable of this. Texting and driving is against the law for a reason. This law was put in place to protect us humans from traumatic car accidents.\\n\\nSome may argue that it\\'s okay to text & drive if you have a self driving car (Requires minimal driver\\'s assistance) but numbers don\\'t lie. According to the NHTSA, there was a Tesla fatality every 86 million miles in 2017, which is 40,000 deaths. Now imagine the amount of accidents in cars that don\\'t drive themselves. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.\\n\\nNow all of these accidents can be eliminated if we as humans just put away their cell phones while behind the wheel. Whatever is being done on one\\'s phone can\\'t wait. A text message is not worth a life.   ',\n",
       " 'Texting and Driving\\n\\nPhones are common in everyday life and everyone has one. When you\\'re driving though a phone can be a factor between life and death or fatal in some way. About 8% of total distracted driving crashes are due to cell phone use (Distracted Driving). Crashes even happen when people reach for their device. When you\\'re out driving somewhere it\\'s better to not pull your phone out at all because you take your eyes off the road, you put yourself and others at risk, and it\\'s banned in a lot of states to even be using (Facts + Statistics).\\n\\nTaking your eyes off the road for just a couple of seconds anything can happen. If you\\'re driving 55mph and you take your eyes off the road for five seconds, which is about the average time someone takes to do something on their device, you could cross an entire football field (4 Reasons). Anything can happen within five seconds the car in front of you could stop, you could run a red light or miss a turn. When you take your eyes off the road you also take your mind of the road.\\n\\nSo obviously if you\\'re not paying attention to the road you put yourself and others in danger, weather they\\'re in the car with you of outside walking someone can get seriously hurt or even die. It\\'s terrible to see something happen to someone just because they were texting and driving or reaching for their phone don\\'t be that person, it makes you look like you don\\'t care about anyone or anything. If you\\'re driving fast and swerve you could crash into a building and that would be bad for you and for everyone else, you won\\'t know what\\'s going to happen after the moment you hit the building debris can hit someone, the building could fall, it would be a terrible accident.\\n\\nAlthough texting and driving is technically not illegal it is banned and you can be fined or in some states spend some time in jail (Texting and Driving). Most states ban texting and driving but not hand held devices. Most states ban novice drivers from using cell phones in general or having them on them at all (Texting and Driving). Around 1.6 million crashes are caused by texting and driving every year and that\\'s 1 of every 4 crashes (Distracted Driving). It\\'s worse than drinking and driving.\\n\\nSo in general it\\'s not worth pulling out or even reaching for your device if it increases the chance of a car accident happening (Motor Vehicle Safety). There are many things that can go wrong it doesn\\'t just have be car collision you could hit something, swerve, miss a turn, drive straight into traffic, etc. There are so many little things you do when driving that are important to your safety that you probably don\\'t even realize. So if you\\'re driving stay away from the phone.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"4 Reasons Why You Shouldn\\'t Text and Drive.\" City of Bryan, Texas, www. bryantx. gov/4-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-text-and-drive/.

       " \"I do not think individuals should have the right to use a cellular device for any reason none whatsoever while driving vehicles. Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a persons attention from the primary task of driving. Distracted driving can fall under 3 different categories which are (visual: taking your eyes off the road), (manual: taking your hands off the wheel.), and (cognitive: taking your mind off what you are doing). The Harvard center of risk analysis shows a study of that estimates cell phone use while driving contributes to 6% of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries and 2,600 deaths each year including a tab that is $43 billion .\\n\\nActivities that can be distractive are cellphone usage, eating, drinking, reading, changing the radio station, doing makeup, doing hair, talking to passengers in the car. The reason why I chose this is because during the year there are 1.6 million crashes each year. Although, nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. The other reason why I chose this decision is because when you send or read a text message, you take your eyes off the road for about 5 seconds, long enough to cover the length of a football field while driving at 55 mph. However, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States I caused by cell phone usage. Approximately, each day in the United States 9 people are killed more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to be involved by a driver distracted by their cellular device.\\n\\nDuring the past years there have been 1.6 million car crashes each year. The people that text while driving are 23 time more than likely to have a car wreck and pass away. However, texting while driving take your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at a time which means your eyes are of the road for a distance of 300 feet. Although, many people in the world expects a reply from a total of 2-5 minutes which puts tremendous pressure on them that makes them want to respond faster. However, 60% of drivers admit to using their cellphones while driving. 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted drivers in 2012. Even though you don't think about it but texting increases your crash risk to 23% more than when not distracted.\\n\\nIn the United States automobiles are a way of life and car accidents are an inevitability. Although, teens think it is so important to text while driving 143 million that communicate daily, there's no doubt that car accidents are bound to happen to be no end in sight. Yearly roughly 1.3 million people die from worldwide car accidents. There is an average of 3,287 deaths per day. From the age of 15-44 they are responsible for all road traffic deaths. Most fatal crashes led to 37,461 total fatalities, including 25,096 vehicle occupants, 5,286 motorcyclists, and 7,079 nonoccupants. The ages 16-19 year old has the higher risk of motor vehicle crashes. However, 15% of drivers ages 15-20 involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year. While on the other hand on average 3,287 deaths a day. However, 20-50 million people are injured during car crashes.       \",\n",
       " \"The Risk of Texting and Driving\\n\\nOver the last few years, texting or talking on the phone has been a rising problem for drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million crashes a year are caused by cell phone use, and because of this, I believe cell phone usage should be banned for those operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIn 2106 alone, 263 teenagers were killed because of cell phone usage while driving. Some of these deaths were not even the teenagers fault, but instead because of a distracted driver crashing into them. Even though texting and driving causes so many deaths, the NHTSA has reported that approximately 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while driving every single day. Why would people continue to use cell phones while driving every day when they know how much of a risk there is? I believe it is for one of two main reasons. Either they are impatient or they aren't worried because they don't think it will happen to them.\\n\\nAs for being impatient, I understand that some people are curious of what a text is or they want an answer to a question, but because of the risk to yourself and those around you, it's worth waiting to answer. Now for those who don't think it will happen to them. Nobody believes that anything they hear about online or on TV will happen to them, but I am almost positive that every person who has died in a car accident, woke up that morning believing the same thing. If you really need to respond to someone immediately for some reason, wait until you are at a red light or a stop sign, or if it's really an emergency just pull off the road for a minute and respond.\\n\\nThere are so many ways to prevent accidents for reasons like these that I don't see why we should need a law. I wish that people would stop texting and driving simply because of the horrible consequences that can come from it. Imagine being a parent at work one day, and all of a sudden you get a call saying that your child had been killed in a car accident. Just by responding to one text, there can be consequences that permanently affect the people and families of the people around you. It's not worth that risk, not to me anyway.                     \",\n",
       " 'Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving a vehicle. If text and drive you\\'re more likely to crash. Texting & driving Is more weakening to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol. There\\'s a lot of hands free technology. You have to think about other people and not just yourself you could hit a person or a car. Those are reasons you should not text and drive.\\n\\nIf you text and drive you\\'re 23 more times likely to crash. In 2011 1.3 million car accidents were caused by texting and driving. In 2015 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in accidents caused by drivers distracted by their phones. Looking at your phone while driving and being distracted is equivalent to drinking four beers. When there is dangerous situation and you\\'re looking at your phone you aren\\'t going to notice. Texting and driving does nothing but put you and other people in danger.\\n\\nWhen you text and drive you\\'re not just putting yourself in danger, but also anyone else in the car or any innocent pedestrians. Regardless of how quickly you feel you can glance at your phone or respond to a text, taking your eyes off the road not only risks the lives of everyone around you, it risks your own life. Texting and driving with children in the car is most importantly a horrible idea as it risks their young innocent lives. It\\'s much easier to just pull over or at least wait till you get to a red-light. If the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!\\n\\nThere\\'s so much new hands free technology, so you shouldn\\'t even want to risk your life. If your phone has Bluetooth enabled on it, it will easily connect to any hands-free device. This means that you have the ability, at the very least, to talk on your mobile phone while driving. Hands-free technology means staying connected while driving and staying alive. Hands- free technology mounted in the car isn\\'t much different from being on your phone, but it\\'s there so take advantage.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is dangerous and you just shouldn\\'t do it. To be honest your life isn\\'t even worth it. Even if you think you\\'re the best driver ever, an accident that could\\'ve been prevented won\\'t be because you aren\\'t focused on the road. It\\'s also a good idea to set the default \"do not disturb\" setting on your phone while driving. Some new phones have a app that senses when you\\'re driving.      ',\n",
       " 'Devices are a distraction for drivers on the road because it always takes aways the drivers attention of the safety of passengers in the vehicle. Another way devices are distractions, it limits your safe driving capacity. Drivers shouldn\\'t be allowed to be on their device while driving because it causes accidents, driver\\'s insurance rate rises and because hand free technology is available.\\n\\nOne reason why drives shouldn\\'t be on their device while driving is because they cause accidents. According to edgarsnyder. org, \"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United Statesis caused by texting and driving.\" From this evidence it states that devices are a threat to the safety of the driver and other drivers on the road.\\n\\nAnother reason why drivers shouldn\\'t be allowed to use their device on the road is because the driver\\'s insurance rate goes up. According to carinsurance. com,\"In Georgia insurance rates with a clean record is $1,776 but after a texting while driving ticket the insurance rate increases into $2,195.\" Insurance Policies does not take texting and driving as a joke; it causes accidents and insurance companies know that too.\\n\\nOne more reason on why drivers shouldn\\'t be allowed to text and drive is because of the availability of hands-free technology in cars. According to strike. au, \"Hands-free technology is arguably one of modern day\\'s most convenient inventions. Our phones are such an integral part of our busy lives and going without them for any amount of time can be detrimental to our day-to-day business dealings. Hands-free technology enables us to talk to people without having to touch a button. Modern day Bluetooth hands-free devices often operate on voice control alone which means that we don\\'t even have to touch a button. Voice control limits distraction and subsequently limits the dangers associated with touching phones when driving.\" From this evidence you can understand that Hands-free technology is the resolution to the problem of texting and driving. With its voice recognition tech you can easily send a text without any distraction keeping your eyes away from the road.\\n\\nTexting and Driving is a serious topic to talk about because people who text and drive risk many lives on the road, threatening other drivers who are perfectly driving and threatening the driver passengers lives. Driver shouldn\\'t be allowed to use their device while driving because it causes accidents, raises insurance rate for the driver and the availability of hands-free technology.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nOver 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages.\\n\\nSince recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians.\\n\\nPhone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nChaudhary, N.

       " 'Phones & Driving in This World\\n\\nIn the world today, many people used technology such as cell phones, computers, or laptops. A lot of people are addicted to things, but the cell phone might be the worst addiction of them all. Cell phones are so addicting that people are risking their lives for them. Driving while using your cell phone is a very dangerous thing to do. Humans should not be able to use their cellular device while driving because it is too dangerous and they are putting other people lives in danger and also their own.\\n\\nUsing any cellular devices while driving is in fact dangerous, people are putting other human beings lives at risk because when you are on your device while driving, you are not paying attention to the road. Paying attention to the road is extremely important because that is what you are supposed to do while driving. So many human beings are putting other people lives in danger by being selfish with their lives. Driving while using your cellular devices should be prohibited.\\n\\nSome people may think that driving while using your cellular device is totally okay. Those people think that if their using their phones while driving, they have an advantage of being a \"pro\" at driving. Other reasonings may be using their devices for navigation or crime reporting, and those are good reasons. Though you can not be too sure of using the cellular devices while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using your electronic device while driving should not be allowed because people are putting others lives in danger. Those people are also putting their own lives in serious danger. When you are driving, you should have your focus completely on the road and watch out for other vehicles. People should not be selfish and look out for other people on the road.       ',\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nNowadays, most people have a cell phone and use them in everyday life. People own cars as well. Imagine mixing the two, phones and cars, using the mobile devices while driving. That doesn\\'t seem so smart but most people do it anyways and it\\'s very dangerous. \"Why is it dangerous?\" you may be thinking. Maybe you\\'re just changing the song playing because it\\'s an annoying one that just started and you don\\'t liked it, maybe someone texted you, maybe your mom is calling you. As simple as changing the song, texting back, or talking to someone on the phone sounds, it\\'s very dangerous. Doing so is known for causing most car accidents today, if the impact is bad then it could lead to death.\\n\\nUsing a mobile device while operating a vehicle is illegal and you\\'ll get pulled over for it if you get caught by a cop. As bad as it already is, yes, hundreds and thousands of people still do it every single day. Maybe the person doing so didn\\'t get pulled over or didn\\'t get in a car accident, but one never knows when that is going to happen. That day can happen sometime today, or tomorrow, or sometime next week. Whether one is bored in traffic, it\\'s still not a good idea to be using the phone.\\n\\nAs for having a hands-free Bluetooth device, that\\'s the only possible outcome for one using a cellular device while operating a vehicle. A Bluetooth is a source of operating a connection between anything, in a vehicle, most people use the connection for their phones so they can drive without touching their phone so they don\\'t have to let go of the steering wheel. Having a Bluetooth is a very helpful and beneficial device to have inside a vehicle.\\n\\nPeople tend to think you should be able to use your phone while driving, not for texting or phone calls, but for directions or a GPS. If one is using their phone for directions to a place then that should be okay. They don\\'t have to be holding their phone as well which is even better. The person with their GPS on, can purchase a phone stand or phone holder that they can install inside of their vehicle. The benefit of having this is that it\\'s both safe, and affordable. With the stand/holder being safe, no phone has to be held with one hand and the other on the steering wheel. One will just have to glance at it for a second or two so they\\'re aware of where they\\'re going. As well as being affordable, it won\\'t hurt purchasing one from your nearest store, it\\'s found inside many stores and pharmacies. Some cars nowadays come with a Bluetooth installed already in the car, so if one\\'s car has it or not, there should be a consideration in purchasing one.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using your phone while driving is very dangerous, but that\\'s why there are Bluetooth and hands-free calls now which makes everything better and safer. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, unless they have a Bluetooth device, which either way, they have to be safe and careful for their safety.         ',\n",
       " 'Cell phones Vs Driving\\n\\nI believe that people being allowed to operate a motor vehicle must never also be allowed to have their phone in their hand while doing so. Cell phones make driving much more dangerous by distracting the driver from the road. In 2019 The state of Georgia made it illegal for driver\\'s to have their phones in their hand while driving. This law is called the \"Hands-Free\" law. Since this law has been put into place a lot more Georgia driver\\'s have been able to reach their destinations.\\n\\nI\\'m on the side of banning any amount of cellphone usage while driving, texting and driving is extremely dangerous and has been proven time and time again of being one of the most common causes of death in the United states. Fun fact actually, more people die from texting and driving than from sharks... So why do we keep letting people do something that we know is more dangerous than swimming with sharks? Because people nowadays are almost addicted to being on their phones. People have become too consumed in the fake reality of phones and social media that they value texting while driving more than their own life it seems. And because of that I strongly believe that driver\\'s should NOT be able to use their phone in any capacity while driving. Sure they may be helpful with navigation and helping you find out where to go, but there are also a million other different distractions that come with the cell phone like the notifications, emails, ringtones, snapchats, and tweets that also come with it and are completely unnecessary while driving.\\n\\nI hope that society comes to their senses and realizes how dangerous and unnecessary phones are when it comes time to drive a motor vehicle. A text can always wait, but someone\\'s life cannot, a text or phone call is never worth the life of a person. I think that banning all cell phone usage in motor vehicles is a necessity and it should be implemented as soon as possible.     ',\n",
       " \"In my opinion i truly believe that people should not be able to use or operate cell phones while driving. There a several reason that i think support this theory. For instance the danger factor, driving while on the phone can pull your concentration from anything and everything that you do. These distractions can easily cause a accident which is putting your life and future at risk. I personally think that the cons of driving and using your phone far outweigh the pros and here why.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that i think that driving and using the phone is unacceptable is because it causes a major distraction. Diverting your attention from driving a vehicle at any time is a enamours mistake because it only takes seconds to crash. Making a small text or call can easily cause you thousands in damages to your car and even another civilians car. Not to mention it can also create a complications with the insurances companies and cause a spike in your current insurance rate.\\n\\nAnother big risk and something that is common among drivers nowadays is being sued. This does not occur very often but can be one of the most troubling and biggest hits to a person's pocket. One second your looking at your phone to check and text and the next you're dealing with a lawsuit that can cause you to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars. When in a scenario like this the opposing person can claim any kind of allgulations weather they be true are not, and you must be liable to either pay up or fight the case in court.\\n\\nWhat really are some pros of driving and texting and calling anyway? For me there's not much that i can really think of. It's clear that the cons outweigh the pros, so why even take the risk. Not only is it a risk to your life buts it's also a risk to your pocket and can be hazardous to other people. In con conclusion to my research i truly believe that texting and driving or doing anything on your phone is definitely unacceptable in modern life.                                        \",\n",
       " \"Driving with a phone isn't always a bad thing, sometimes people have a valid reason to be driving with their phone and aren't always trying to just goof around. Like, for example, when I drive, I have to use my phone whenever my mom or dad call me or I have to call my mom to tell her if I have practice or not after school.\\n\\nMost people don't have newer cars that have built-in GPS, or even a touch screen which means they have to use their phone if their driving out of town and need a GPS or need to use their phone to contact a friend or family member to make sure there in the correct places to get where they're going.\\n\\nLast year during soccer season, I had to call my mom in order to let her know if our practice was ever cancelled or ask her to bring me food before the game, which meant she was using her phone while driving home after work, but was for a good reason. My mom has an older car that has a touch screen put into, it but she still has to take her eyes off the road to answer the phone on the touch screen which is just like using her phone, so what's the point of her not being able to use her phone?\\n\\nThe average cost of a 2018-19 car is about twenty to thirty thousand dollars and even though they come with a built in touch screen, the average American can't afford a newer model car. This means they get a touch screen built in, if possible, but even using a touch screen can be as distracting as a phone. This shouldn't make people who have to use their phone a bigger target than someone who is using a touch screen who could be doing ever knows what. So using a phone while driving shouldn't be something worthy of being pulled over for.\\n\\nTrue texting and driving seems bad and is the cause of about every car wreck. Most people still text and drive, but they focus their attention mainly on the road when driving or they use it while at a stop sign or on an open road. Texting while driving shouldn't be seen as such a big deal as long as you're at a complete stop while driving due to the fact that you can't always pull over to somewhere safe to use your phone if you're heading somewhere new for the first time.\\n\\nOver all, texting while driving isn't something you should always do, but shouldn't be something you be fined $50 dollars for. If anything, it should just be at most for the first offence $15, and after that $25. Everyone has used their phone at least once while driving since the hands-free law was passed. Most people who didn't follow the law were probably using their phone for something important, others maybe not. But, when texting and driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings and try to use it when you're at a complete stop or able to pull over.                                                 \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday in this world people expect their cellphone to do everything for them when driving, I don't think cellphones should be used while operating a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving or anything could cause you to have a car accident. Or somebody can lose their life because of something you did when it shouldn't have been done at all. Cell phones are a distraction to humans today because they're so stuck on their screen that they forget their driving. people should not be able to use their devices while driving because you are not focused on the road or your surroundings. you can also miss your turn or miss a light while looking at your device most people can't focus on two things at once, especially while driving it's a distraction.\\n\\nThere are a number of crashes due to the phone calls that are being held when driving.\\n\\nBecause of this people should have bluetooth so they can be able to answer the phone and be safe driving to. Many lives has been taken because of texting and driving or driving and being on the phone. Today people should not be able to use their phones because of the crashes and the lives taken. CellPhones has not been around for so long but they have become a part of our lives.\\n\\nPeople are picking and choosing the wrong time to answer their phone and to text somebody back . Today people are so focused on what they can do at one time instead of focusing on the street and trying not to hurt themselves or somebody else .\\n\\nToday people do not think about other people when using their cell phone they be so focused on keeping in touch with everyone and making themselves. People think it is so important to have a cellphone on them while driving when it is not safe. When you are taking your drivers test you learn not to take your eyes off the street when driving . Not only is having your phones out while driving is illegal it is very danguorse and not safe texting and being on the phone is learned when you first take your drivers test. If you get caught while using a cellphone you will get a warning and if they catch you again then you get a ticket .\\n\\nTexting while driving is banned for people younger than 18 because us teens do not know how to keep our eyes on the road because we be in our phones and on social media. When we be in our phones we be distracted and not paying attention to the road we miss a light or we pass a stop sign . they should ban texting while driving but not having a cellphone while driving you need a phone on you because if you get into an accident you would need to call the police.\\n\\nTexting while driving is a bad habit that most people have when their phone ding they think there supposed to reply back to a message when there actually putting there self in danger and the person behind ,front and the side of them.\\n\\nIn the conclusion people should make smarter decisions about what there going to do while driving. If your going to text and drive maybe you should not drive you should have somebody driving for you. All lives matter you shouldn't want to end someone else life because your making a dumb decision by having your phone out while driving. just like drinking and driving isnt safe texting a driving isnt either you shouldnt do neither. They made it illegal just because of these reasons you can crash you can kill somebody anything can happen when taking your eyes off the road         \",\n",

Well, they are wrong, using phones while driving lead too many people in car accidents, killing other people, and you\\'ll be fined much money, even if you don\\'t crash or anything like that. People shouldn\\'t be allowed to drive and use their phone for theirs and others safety.\\n\\nWhile many people think using their phone while driving isn\\'t hard, but there have been tons of accidents because of people using their phones while driving. \"In 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers.\" This shows that car accidents are now a more commonly known way people die. Usually, a car accident only involves 3 or 4 people are involved so if the number of killed and injured are so high then that shows that the number of car accidents is also high. That shows that people can\\'t be on their phones and driving.\\n\\nDriving and usage of phones do cause accidents; it could also cause the driver to run over people. \"A staggering 37,461 people were killed on US roads in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous year, according to just-released statistics from the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration.\" All of these accidents have occurred ever since phones came out and that\\'s because we all think we are able to multitask. When it comes to driving we need all of our attention on it and not anywhere else because then we don\\'t see people crossing the road. All these deaths are being cause by the fact that we can\\'t leave our phones until we get to our destination.\\n\\nAfter many years of distracted driving the US is finally doing something about it, they instated a law that if you are caught using your phone or it\\'s just in your lap you\\'ll be fined. \"Motorists operating commercial vehicles who violated the distracted driving law are subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,750.\" That may seem too much money for a small thing, but it could save many lives including your own. Using your phone won\\'t only get you fined, it\\'ll also get your license suspended, which you won\\'t be getting back for a long time. With just one time using your phone while driving will take your money, which you worked hard to get.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people should learn that using their phone while driving will only lead to bad things.

       " 'No Phones Behind The Wheel\\n\\nCell phones are devices that connects people all around the world and also is a main way of communication. Through the use of social media such as twitter, snapchat, and instagram many can interact with each other electronically rather than in person. Not only did these devices create a new platform of communication, but also expanded the idea of social interaction. However, cell phones are known to become very addictive and can be considered a hazardous device when used under the wrong circumstances. It can become a major distraction and even put many lives in danger, including the driver. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle as it can cause life threatening accidents, inattentional blindness, and goes against the law in many states.\\n\\nAs millions of people use cars as a mode of transportation, cellular devices can easily be accessed on a regular basis and put drivers at risk of a serious accident. Not only could this affect one person, but also others in the roadway that are also in risk due terrible decision making by one person. As these devices become more of an occurrence, studies have shown,\"\\n\\n....annual injury and fatal reports found that the use of cellphones causes 26% of the nation\\'s car accidents, a modest increase from the previous year\" (USA Today). This comes to show that about one fourth of car accidents are caused by cell phones, very dangerous and deadly device that can change an outcome on the roadway in a heartbeat. All in all, as people become more dependent on phones, the percentage of car accidents will only increase throughout the years.\\n\\nInattentional blindness is a resulting factor from cellular devices as it draws attention away from the road and results in not fully noticing visible objects in plain sight. A main example of this is driving while texting; as the brain is focused on sending out a text, an individual can fail to perceive an object from the corner of their eye. Even though the humans brain is advanced in so many ways, it still has its difficulties,\" When we are driving, the is a huge amount of sensory information that our brain must deal with\" (Pammer). As a result, drivers can not one hundred percent focus on driving and sending out a text at the same time due limited usage of how the brain works. Thus, by having temporary inattentional blindness drivers can put their lives and other lives at risk as well simply because their lack of attention on the highway.\\n\\nIn addition, not only can driving while using a cellular device lead to a fatal or very serious accident, but it also be illegal depending on the state. By texting and driving in states like Georgia, a driver can face fines when caught by the police. This law which is banning people by physically using their cell phones while driving only adds more safety precaution,\" Those caught breaking the rules- even tapping \"play\" on a spotify playlist while not parked- face a 50$ fine which doubles upon their second offense\" (USA Today). Due to more and more people being prone to car accidents as a result of cell phone usage, more laws are being made to punish these users so fatalities or injuries can be prevented. To sum up, as drivers become more attached to their phones and abuse their right to drive legally, punishments are being made to keep the road safe and protected from reckless driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phones also has many positives as it increases the way many people interact with one another. Google maps and different other apps can be very beneficial when it comes to finding specific locations. However, with many perks comes many flaws as these devices can cause a life changing accident in a matter of seconds. It can also be a sneaky distractor in which it can take a drivers full attention off the road and minimize their vision on it. Heavy fines and serious consequences may be taken place when a cellular device is used in a state where it is illegal. In summary, as this very popular innovation develops, drastic measures have to be taken into place to prevent harmful disasters on the roads.         ',\n",
       " \"The Risks of Phones While Driving\\n\\nTechnology has been a part of our lives for many years. Within these years, technology has progressed. As it progresses, it causes people to stop paying attention to what needs to be done. This loss of attention can cause different situations to occur such as bumping into other people or hitting a wall while walking. Just as phones are a distraction while doing everyday activities, they are also a distraction while driving. They cause people to not pay attention to the cars around them; they don't know how or when to break, they may roll through a stop sign or just might hit another car all together because they were not focused on what they needed to be focused on. Consequences come with the actions that people take. If a person is not paying attention to the road, then he could cause an accident just as if someone is not paying attention to the person in front of him, he might run into them. There are minor and major risks that come with people being on the phone while driving. Using phones while driving should not be allowed because it is a risky idea and can cause accidents as well as legally affecting a person's driving history.\\n\\nTo begin with, driving is not an activity to do just for fun. It should be taken seriously and all of a person's attention should be on the road. As a result of the loss of attention to the road whether it be visual, manual or cognitive; phones cause accidents. When someone is not paying attention, his reaction time is slower. This could include not paying attention and thinking about everything but what is on the road, a person not having his hands on the wheel or not having his eyes on the road. Because of these things, there are some accidents that are minor where the other vehicle is hit and only leaves a dent in the vehicle where they were hit. But also, some accidents are serious enough to have one or both vehicles totaled, has someone seriously injured or someone could even lose a life from the careless actions of the other driver. So many people have died or have been seriously injured from the careless actions of drivers being on the phone and there is nothing that anyone can do to take it back. Someone's life cannot be taken back. It is not possible to take back hitting someone and paralyzing them or giving them brain damage because of the amount of impact they got from the car that hit them. There are ways to prevent anyone from being in any kind of situation like these. If riding alone, the phone should be in a position where it is hard to reach and should only be touched when at a complete stop or if the car is turned off. No type of notification is worth losing a life over. Also, have the phone where it will not move or slide in places that are hard to reach. If the phone falls underneath the break, it is very dangerous, and it is just as dangerous trying to reach it while driving. Another way to keep everyone on the road safe is to make sure that when passengers are in the car, that everyone understands and respects the rules of the car. Having passengers in the car could be a huge distraction just like phones. Also, having someone to respond to messages and alerts will help eliminate any possible problems. Keeping the car distraction free, especially phone free, will cause for a better rate for not just teenage drivers but all drivers.\\n\\nLegal actions are also something to consider when someone is driving with a phone in his possession. Seeing police officers on the road instantly puts a fear in people and will cause for a change in actions by the driver. People know what is right and wrong but still do as they please. Hands free driving is a law and it is broken on a daily. People try to alter the law and make it to where it best fits their needs. If an accident is caused because of the carelessness of a driver being on the phone while driving, police marks that on a person's license and too many marks could later lead to the suspension of a person's license. Being on the phone can take time and money away from a person.\\n\\nPhones are not the only distractions that can go on while someone is driving. They could be talking too much, looking at the stores, signs or other cars or eating. Although these things can be done in a matter of seconds, those few seconds can quickly change. There is so much to life and always being on the phone will never get anyone there especially when driving. A lot of people already do not pay attention without phones and having a phone makes it worse. Whatever it is that comes to your phone can wait. Multitasking while driving is never worth the risk of being hurt or losing a life. It is not worth a life.    \",\n",

       " \"Do you use your cell phone while driving? More than half of car accidents that occur are caused by drivers who use their cell phone while driving. Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving. Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident. The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life. Even if the accident is not big it still could have been prevented by not using your cell phone.\\n\\nCar accidents are one of the main things that are caused by drivers who use their cell phones but it's not the only things that gets caused by using your phone while you're driving. Sometimes you might pull your phone out at a red light but you don't realize the light has turned green which means you're causing traffic. Traffic is something mostly every driver hates. What if the person behind you has somewhere important to be but thanks to you you're holding them back because you got distracted with your phone? If someone is calling you and you have your phone in your purse or somewhere else in the car you're going to get distracted trying to pull it out of where you have it. If you have Bluetooth on your car you should connect it so it's easier to answer the call without having to try pull your phone out of where it's at. If you do not have Bluetooth, you should try putting your phone on do not disturb so that way you won't have the temptation to want to pull it out. Maybe even fully shut it down or just turn the sound off.\\n\\nEvery day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone. Using your cell phone while driving is a big no. Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there. Just knowing your friends texted you or someone posted / sent you something you'll most likely want to take a quick little glance at your phone but then that's going to want to make you use it for even longer which gets you distracted. Maybe you don't like what's on the radio so you want to use your aux to you can put a song you actually like if this does occur just wait till you're at red light but as soon as you're done doing that put it away you don't want to cause traffic. All of these things are ways your cell phone can get you distracted.\\n\\nStop using your cell phones while the car is on drive. Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you. What if there's a baby in the car? Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat. All of that could have waited till you got to your destination. Stop letting these little things get to you. Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted. Everything that just happened could have been stopped if you only would have waited and not let your phone distract you.\\n\\nSome people never realize how much a cell phone can actually cause. This because some people never stop and think about their actions. Yes, your cell phone might be small but the impacts it can cause are huge. Next time you want to pull your cell phone out wait till you get to your destination because a phone call or message is not more important than your own life. If someone important is calling your or texting just tell them, you were driving and they should be able to understand that.\\n\\nA picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification. If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.         \",\n",
       " \"In my opinion I think cell phones shouldn't be used while driving because it has a big impact on the people. It has bad causes such as people getting into life threatening wrecks and people can't just focus on the road. People use them to text while driving and they thousands die because of it every year. It has a terrible impact on today's society because we can't put phones down.\\n\\nPhones are not good to the public because people can't focus on the road and the environment surrounding them. Even though you can call the authorities with a swipe of a finger, they are the reason they get into the wrecks. I feel like if you have an emergency you should pull over instead of stopping and causing a wreck. People just don't think about the outcome of using phones while driving. People only don't have to look out for themselves but other drivers.\\n\\nPhones not only distract us from the road but from our day to day life. They distract us from spending time with our families and friends. It also distracts us from watching movies. It distracts us from just the good moments we have and share. Phones are a very distracting thing to our lives and they need to be put down for a bit so we can have some actual time to ourselves. Everyone sticks to social media now and it just isn't good.\\n\\nIn Conclusion phones are no good to us and our day to day life. I think people shouldn't text and drive or just be on their phones in general because it could be fatal to your health if you get a wreck or just looking at your surroundings.   \",\n",
       " \"Having your cell phone out while driving is one of those deadly issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.\\n\\nSocial media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.\\n\\nAs for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I understand that sometimes your family members or important calls may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car due to the hazard of the road you are putting your safety and other's safety at risk.\\n\\nEven hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.\\n\\nWhatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Pull over to the side and tell the person you are trying to text that your driving and it's dangerous. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.   \",\n",
       " \"Do you think it's ok for people do drive while having a cell phone? Well in my opinion i think people should not have a cell phone while driving because cell phone use while driving statistics shows that the behavior is common in dangerous in teens drivers. According to the national safety council 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics shows that multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. High school students who reported frequent texting while driving where less likely to wear a seatbelt more likely too ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol. Driving while talking or texting on the cell phone .The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads too 1.6million crashes each year. Teen driver with only one additional passenger doubles the risk of getting into a fatal car accident. Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults too get into car crashes when talking or testing on the cell phone. while driving many things can cause you to crash talking and texting, gps, adjusting music, putting on makeup,talking too the passenger, and not looking at the road.    \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nTexting and driving has become a huge issue. Many car accidents have occurred by being on the phone. Most people think texting and driving is not a serious thing but in reality, it has caused many lives. Police have been cracking down and a lot on this situation. Phone companies like Apple have put a do not disturb setting on the phone for driving. You turn it on and it will silence all calls and texts messages, so it won\\'t temp you to pick up your phone. Many teens have been in an accident due to texting and driving. This has become a dangerous issue in society that has caused many lived and needs to be stopped.\\n\\nIn this paragraph I am going to be talking about the dangers that texting and driving have. Currently 46 states have banned texting and driving due to many accidents. This problem is occurring a lot with young teens. Many teens don\\'t know how to put their phone down while driving they feel they need to always have it in their hand. 21% of teen drivers who were involved in fatal car accidents were distracted by their cell phones. 330,000 injuries arise each year from texting a driving. There are many organizations dealing with texting and driving. They also have addictions programs if you are addicted to your phone and cannot put it down. Phone addiction is a real thing, many people struggle with and don\\'t realize it. Sources say that \"94% of drivers support imposing a ban on texting while driving\". It has been proven that texting while driving its 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk and that really should tell you something. This is huge problem that can be solves so easily if people would just put their phone down.\\n\\nMany car companies have been making self-driving cars. This makes people think it is okay to be on their phone while driving because the car is driving itself when in realty it is just as dangerous. I think texting white driving is a horrible thing I think it should be banned. I say this because many have died and many more were injured. It should not be allowed at all it puts the person that\\'s driving in danger and other drivers. I think that police cracking down on texting and driving is a good thing. It will make more people stop doing it if they know they will get a ticket or possibly jail time. People will not stop until they know it will be serious consequences, they don\\'t take it as a big deal. Research also shows that when people are talking on the phone, crash risk quadruples. The national safety council estimated that cellphone use leads to more than 1.6 million crashes every year. A first offence of texting while driving is 50 or more. I think that price needs to be much high then 50 dollars. I say this because if tickets were higher like maybe 100 or more lots of people wouldn\\'t be texting and driving because they wouldn\\'t want to pay that high ticket.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think texting and driving is a horrible thing that needs to be stopped. How many more lives is it going to take before people see how horrible it is. As a society we need to do better for our safety. We need to stop being so distracted by our phones and focus on making it where we need to go safely. The biggest age group affected by this problem is aging from 16 to 30. We need our young teens and our adults to do better and learn to put the phone down for their own safety. In the end we all want our country to be better and safer place. We want to live are life to the fullest and enjoy the good times so we should start thinking wise and be safer and it can start by not texting while driving.     ',\n",
       " 'Many humans these days own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. This includes in their vehicles. From changing the music, to texting someone, to even being on the phone.

It is also illegal in some states to use a phone while driving.

Someone who is distracted from the road has the potential to injure or even kill someone. There have been many instances where people have been hit by a distracted driver.

If people are continued to have feeble punishments then they will continue to kill thousands of people.    ',\n",
       " 'Texting & Driving\\n\\nIt is very hard to find someone who doesn\\'t text or use their phone multiple times a day.\\n\\nSince we are so used to sending hundreds of texts a day, we don\\'t really see how it can be dangerous. However, doing so while driving could result in your life. Not only do we put ourselves and anyone in the car at risk while we text, we also endanger the other drivers on the road as well. Almost 400,000 crashes each year involve texting and driving.\\n\\nMany people fail to realize just how impactful texting and driving can be. \"More than 1,000 people are injured every day due to a distracted driver,\" (Texting & Driving). DRivers think that looking away for 3 seconds to send a message is harmless, but over 1000 are injured and more than 10 of those die everyday. \"In 2015 42% of teens say they have texted while driving-and texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens,\" (Texting & Driving). Texting and driving while being a teen is especially dangerous, do to the fact they have not had many years of practice. \"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year,\" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). Car crashes are inevitable, but if we didn\\'t text while we drove over a million crashes each year could be prevented.\\n\\nMany dangers are presented amongst the topic of operating a vehicle while texting.\\n\\nHowever, as most of us know this, it doesn\\'t seem to affect their actions. \"Hefty fines, License suspension, Rise in auto insurance rates, and even Prison time,\" (Texting & Driving), are some of the penalties most states have applied. Studies have shown that it is worse to texting and drive, than it is to drive drunk. So we do we do it? Why do we find it so tempting to look at our phones and text when we are behind the wheel, even if we know what it could result in? While we all use our phones every day, it may be easy to glance over, however there are ways to help decrease the amount of accidents. Many phones even have a restriction set called \"Do Not Disturb\" that you can use to hide alerts. This helps prevent you from looking at a newly received message.\\n\\nLooking and using a phone while driving can be very tempting. However, it is up to us to help stop over a million crashes from occurring each year. If we all stopped using our phones while driving we could not only save ourselves, but others in the car with us, and our fellow drivers on the road. Is that text really worth the cost?\\n\\nWorks Cited https://www. dmv. org/distracted-driving/texting-and-driving. php https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. ht ml   ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nAccording to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nHowever, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\\n\\nPeople whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   \",\n",
       " 'Cell phones were first presented in the US in the time of 1980 and their utilization right away developed during the following two decades. One of the essential explanations behind the enormous development of phones is that they encourage correspondence offering an increasing amount of adaptability contacting wanted individuals inside seconds. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Different drivers out and about consider drivers on their mobile phones whether they need to or not in light of the dangers they make. Mobile phones allow users to reach others during crisis notwithstanding during driving, in spite of a viable method for correspondence, utilizing cell phones during driving outcomes in diverting consideration of driver increasing road safety concerns.\\n\\nTo begin with, we have turned out to be so centered around the amount we can do at one time that we are eager to chance our own security just as the wellbeing of others since we can\\'t put down our cell phones. Studies found that a cell phone put drivers at a four times more serious danger of an accident. When driving, once in a while it is hard to concentrate out and about which makes it simple to overlook that the streets are shared by everybody and not for your use. A young lady slaughtered a walker on a bike while she was messaging on her telephone. She might not have proposed to take such an individual\\'s life, however she settled on the poor choice to drive and text which she needs to live with for the rest of her life. Any of us could have been that poor individual on that portentous day. Regardless of the dangers, individuals still use cell phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says \"He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph.\" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of \" ... the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids.\" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians.\\n\\nOn the other hand, those whose work relies upon a mobile phone like legal advisors or agents state that they generally must be accessible to pick up the telephone to keep their business running. Be that as it may, due to their propensities, they can make risky and unsafe circumstances like an impact or a mishap. Business issues can be upsetting and perilous while driving since it can cause enthusiastic responses that can prompt disaster. As a result of the discussion they may get furious and this can bring down their driving capacity that can prompt lose power over the vehicle. If Individuals don\\'t settle on a choice to secure their mobile phones their routine can hurt honest individuals. Rivals state that without hands set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. Nonetheless, without hands gadgets don\\'t wipe out the danger of causing a mishap and even may it intensify by recommending that the conduct is sheltered. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing headset can be as risky as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture individual who they conversing with and that doesn\\'t meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves startlingly or person on foot venture into traffic, and the mind comes up short on the handling capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn\\'t in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap in view of need man oeuvre, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the especially time.\\n\\nIn conclusion , if individuals don\\'t surrender their cell phones, the quantity of fatalities on the streets will even now increment. It is individuals duty to not bring about their very own and others individuals lives. these days mobile phones are pointless gadgets since they are untrustworthy in crisis circumstances while On Star is dependably plan to help you in a mishap. Reckless driving is something that we as a whole get very worked up about, particularly on the off chance that it makes us late or is generally an immediate burden to us.      ',\n",
       " 'Drivers should not be able to use a cell in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I feel like that\\'s the least safe thing you can do while a driving a motored vehicle. I think all of your undivided attention should be focused on driving. Your life isn\\'t the only one in harm, but you\\'re also jeopardizing someone else\\'s life putting them in harm. Safety first; extracurricular activities later.\\n\\nFirst of all, driving while you\\'re on your phone is very dangerous and can be life threating within just 5 seconds. Most car accidents today are from people who were distracted by their phones. According to statistics from \"The National Safety Council\", cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. I feel like if more people were less distracted by their phones then there would be fewer car accidents than there are today. One out every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nSecond of all, though you may be only replying to a quick text or answering a quick call, but those few seconds you took to look at your phone traffic is still going. I agree that phones should not be in use while operating a vehicle because not only does the phone user get dangerously injured, it could cause someone else get hurt, too. I would advise anyone to not get caught driving while using their device now today because there are consequences.\\n\\nA cell phone should not be used while operating a vehicle because driving should be number one priority.\\n\\nThird of all, although I feel as if phones shouldn\\'t be prohibited while operating a car but there are some reasons it would be reasonable to use your phone while driving. I think the only reason you should use your phone is too answer important calls only nothing more. The only way you could answer those important calls are if you have Bluetooth and your phone is connected. I feel that if you have to remove your hand from the steering wheel to use your phone you shouldn\\'t. I say phones should shouldn\\'t be used at all inside of a vehicle that on.\\n\\nMost of all, drivers shouldn\\'t use their phone while driving because it\\'s very life threatening and dangerous. Driving while texting doesn\\'t only just put your life in harm it puts others that are around. Texting and driving is a big distraction; focus should always be number priority while driving. Most accidents that occur today are from distracted drivers who were on their phone .Even though they were on phones for short amount of time, within that time span a car accident can occur.

       " \"I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have been the car with people who has almost run in to someone's back on numerous occasions because they was focused on texting on their phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing ones insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their phone more than they are with their safety or safety of others\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. People are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. While the cell phone has many positive attributes like keeping people in touch, the cell phone becomes very dangerous when a person decides to drive and use it. Many States has passed laws that stops texting and driving such as Georgia hands free law. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your own use.\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally to carry out a dangerous activity like driving. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving or keeps looking down at their phone.\\n\\nPeople whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nConcluding if cell phones gets banned everywhere while driving it will decrease the accident and death rate of using a cell phone while driving.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nPhones have been around for several of years. They have become a crucial part of everyday society. They actually make life easier. These devices help with communication, entertainment, & education. Though they help with all these things phones also hinder us. Human have become dependent on their phones. We don't know what to do without them. We use them at wrong times. For example when we are driving. Drivers use their phones all the time. Some times for the right reason. Some times for the wrong. There has been an age old debate asking if drivers should be able to use their phones while driving. I believe that drivers should be able to use their phone while driving\\n\\nI say drivers should be able to use their phones while driving, but to an extent. Drivers should be able to use their phones to perform certain task. For example they should be able to use their phones for directions. I feel that is a reasonable reason for drivers to be on their phone. It can prevent drivers from getting lost on the road. It can help people get to their destination if they get lost. Also I feel talking on the phone can be an acceptable while driving. Even though people will take advantage of that privilege it's important to have that ability.\\n\\nEven though I feel people should be able to use their phones I see where people's concern comes from. Humans have a tendency to get distracted very easy. This has been proven several times. Driving is something that requires a lot of concentration and adding phones to the mix can make it harder. Though this is true people can multitask. Also there are ways for the government to make using your phone and driving is safe. Put regulations in play that limit the use of phones. I feel that would solve a lot of the problems around this topic.\\n\\nI believe the people should be able to use their phone while driving. There's really nothing you can do to stop people from doing it. Instead of trying to make it illegal just put some regulations in play. That will give the people what they want while making it safe to drive. These are reasons why I feel people should be allowed to use their phone while driving.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nPhones and driving is where you text, call, or use your phone in any way. It's very dangerous and I think people should not be able to do it to keep them safe and the other people around them safe as well. Many things can happen when being distracted from driving such as a little crash as a bump to a car or can be as serious as hitting someone or injuring yourself it can also lead to your or even someone else death.\\n\\nIn most cases people from the age 18-33 admitted to using the phone while driving about 59% of them. They say the reason they do this is because they feel as if they are safe and wont crash, but some of them have admitted that they have been involved in an accident.\\n\\nSome people feel as if sending a simple text won't do any harm so it's fine to respond or if someone is calling they should pick it up rather than let it ring.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is a very dangerous thing to do because it can cause a lot of damage and can make some people pay lots of money. Some people don't realize how bad it is to do these things because the people who do it are the ones who have been involved in an accident.\\n\\nThere are many different consequences some can be $20-$500 but if you kill or harm others than if can be jail or prison time all the way up to life in prison one thing that can happen is you can kill yourself doing this or kill a kid who could grow up to be the president or the person to find the cure for cancer or just a very important person. Using you phone might not get you killed but it can get others killed.\\n\\nIn conclusion using your phone for any reason isn't worth it because not only are you in danger but others as well. If I were you I wouldn't use your phone because even if you don't get caught that means you'll do it again and the next time you do than that could be the time you get hurt or killed. What I think new could do to keep this from happening is putting cameras around the roads to see who uses their phone and write them a ticket and or fine them.   \",\n",

       " \"In today's society, a majority of people use cellular devices in their every day. Amazingly, over 62.9 percent of the population has mobile devices. Of course, it is incredible that such a large amount of people can have these devices; however, with all these people can come to many accidents. In this case, texting and driving can become a significant problem when many people have cellular devices. Texting and driving cause many issues on the road and drivers should not be able to use these cell phones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nThe main reason for using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should not be allowed because it is proven to increase the chance of fatal accidents on the road. May researchers can attest to the fact that when cellular devices are in use while the driver is also operating behind the wheel accidents are more likely. Cell Phones reduce the mental capacity of the person performing the automobile; which can lead to slower reaction times, perception, and slower breaking times/speeds. All of these traits can attribute to more automobile crashes, some that could even be fatal.\\n\\nThe second reason why drivers should not be able to be behind the while using s phone is that insurance rates will rise. As more accidents continue to happen due to a cellphone-distracted driver insurance companies will decide to raise the prices of insurance. This will, of course, hurt many of us who may not have the money for a high insurance bill every month. However, if drivers were not to use their cellular device while driver we would not have to worry about this situation. Thus, drivers not being able to use their cellphone is a win-win situation for everyone.\\n\\nOn the hand, some people may disagree and say that drivers should be able to use their cell phone while drivers. These people may believe that if you drive while texting that your sense of alertness may become better and make you better at multitasking since you have to do both at the same time. However, there is no reliable scientific proof using your phone while being behind the wheel Makes you better at multitasking. There is scientific evidence that doing so does the exact opposite, which is why my claim that drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cellular devices while operating an automobile. The main reasons are because of the risk it can put on not only the drivers but others, and the risk of increased insurance rates. Some may argue that using your phone and driving makes you better at multitasking, however, that is just false. I hope my essay has allowed you to see the reasons why we should not use our phones and drive.         \",\n",

People use cell phones in their every day lives. Cell phones provide a quick and easy way to access important information, a quick call or easy access to the internet. Cell phones usage has it pros and cons. Cell phones are used for safety causes like emergencies. It is not safe to use cell phones on the road, but it is a quick way to contact the police in an emergency. It is said that cell phones are a great way for communication, but using cell phones while driving distracts the driver from the road, which is very dangerous for the driver and other drivers on the road.\\n\\nMillions of people are using their cell phones right now. Cell phones provide communication. Cell phones have several benefits, including a camera, music, games, messaging, internet access and apps that can be downloaded for work or school. Cell phones can provide comfort and safety. Cell phones also have dangerous side effects. People may get too attached to their phone, use it while driving or for illegal matters. The main thing with driving while using a cell phone is that it can cause the death of the driver as well as others. In my opinion I do not think anyone should have their phone out while driving. I feel as if it is an emergency you should pull over and handle your situation. That one moment you pull your phone out could cause a big accident. I believe it is best if you keep your phone up and if you feel as if you need to make a call, text someone you should wait and pull over or just wait until you get where you are going.\\n\\nCell phones are not the only thing that can distract the drivers from the road. Lighting a cigarette, talking to a passenger, eating and drinking can all distract the driver and make it unsafe. The distraction of the driver could cause them to miss road signs or switching over to the wrong side of the road. However, cell phone usage on the road may be one of main causes of accidents and deaths. Using your cell phone does not only distract you from the road, but also in class or at work. Cell phones has became a big distraction in our everyday life. Kids and teens isolate themselves from family and family time/functions because they would rather be on cell phone then go outside. Some people cannot even watch a movie without being distracted, or cannot have real conversations because they are obsessed by what is on their phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phones are a great way of communication, but using cell phones while driving distracts the driver from the road which is dangerous for the driver and other drivers on the road.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. The feeling is that young drivers find it enough of a challenge to operate a car, and that any distractions are dangerous. The punishment you get for using a hand-held phone while driving is commensurate with how dangerous that behaviour. A part of the problem is people may answer an email or text they consider to be urgent while driving and because they don't have an accident, they think it's safe to do again. Ways to prevent this from happening; Put your phone away while driving. Putting your phone on mute or turning your phone off entirely is a sure-fire way you to avoid being distracted by it while you're driving. Have a conversation with people in your car or on the phone (even hands-free).To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use Siri to command your phone to read your messages or to reply back.

I think that everyone should consider using this feature on their cell phones because it can potentially save their life or someone else\\'s.\\n\\nFurthermore, I think that driving while using your phone is not only dangerous, but it\\'s also could be the reason for half of America\\'s fatalities. It only takes seconds for someone to look down at their phone and cause a wreck. Cell phone usage itself is expanding, but I think that if people aren\\'t considerate of their lives they should be considerate of others. For example, phone usage while driving could include snap chatting, taking selfies, searching for a song, or as simple as using your phone for directions. Phenomenally, phone usage has turned into a habit.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen people use their phones while driving and it makes me question if they even care about their own lives. I think that risking someone else\\'s life to check social media, respond to a message, or simply changing a song is ignorant. In today\\'s society, phone usage has become a serious problem and I want to stress to millennials and my fellow peers, it can wait. Seeing people using their phones while driving not only bothers me, but it concerns me about the well being of my family. Phone usage while driving can cause car accidents, which can lead to a lifelong lesson. Whether the car accident results in a bad injury or death, it can change your life, forever.\\n\\nSubsequently, as a teenager, I commonly see my friends posting videos while driving down the road with my other friends. Cell phone usage and driving are very illegal but most get away with it because they do it discreetly. I think that in today\\'s time, everyone struggles with the concept of not \"texting and driving\". As mentioned before , my peers texting or making snapchat videos while driving, could cost them their lives. Mentioned on Healinglaw. com, there are stories teeneagers getting into wrecks because of the distractions of phone usage and their passengers distracting them. This careless act resulted in a bad wreck, which caused serious injuries. I often think to myself, \"why would one want to put someone else\\'s life at risk, over a text?\" Something that I realized was that I cannot control my friend\\'s actions, but I can control my own. I love my life enough to not risk it over a text message.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I think that even though phone usage while driving can be very tempting, it is not necessary. I think that phone usage while driving should continue to be illegal, I do not agree with putting someone\\'s life at risk over a simple text or video. Putting your own life in danger or someone else\\'s life in danger is a careless act that must be shunned upon. I also don\\'t agree with the simple distractions that come along with phone usage and driving. Once one is behind the wheel, their phone should be on the do not disturb mode, and they should put their phones face down until they reach their destination. If a person has to use their GPS system while driving, it should be properly mounted in their car in concordance with all of the existing cell phone usage while driving laws. With that being said, I understand the concept of using a GPS while driving. However, I disagree with the concept of cell phone usage to text others and the use of social media platforms while driving. It can wait.\\n\\nWork Cited 1.

       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nMany people follow the rules when driving and many people don't. There can be a lot of safety hazards when you are texting and operating a vehicle. Drivers need to be very careful when operating a vehicle because, they can put people's lives at risk. But, many people do not realize the safety concerns or that you should never use technology while driving.\\n\\nResearch shows that texting and driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst case could kill other people.\\n\\nWhile many people are pretty good a multi-tasking, on the road is not the place to put this skill in use. Texting and driving not only requires keeping your eyes on the road but also a combination of motor skills, not to mention that there is already enough going on with traffic so why add the additional distraction. Trying to do too many things at once confuses the brain and makes it difficult to focus on driving and reaction time. For example, imagine driving on a busy road. You are going 65 mph staring down on your lap, as soon as you look up you crash into a car and you kill the person you hit. It would be your fault and you would have to suffer the consequences all because you wanted to text and drive.\\n\\nResearchers have come to prove that, Cell Phone Use While Driving Increases the Risk of an Accident. One out of 20 drivers use a cell phone when they're in the car, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). However, doing so makes you four times more likely to get into an accident. Texting while driving is even worse.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving not only puts your life in danger but it also puts others life in danger. That's why when you drive your phone should be muted. Put aside all the distractions such as phones, loud music and headphones. Putting those things aside could prevent death while driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because the action is extremely dangerous for every person on the road.\\n\\nAccording to the studies conducted by the National Safety Council, it was shown that using a cell phone while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year with 390,000 of them resulting in injuries. The reasoning behind this is when the driver takes their attention away from the road, the dangerousness of the situation increases by 400%. During the time the driver looks down at their phone to check a message, read the GPS, or receive a phone call, an accident can occur. Therefore, to prevent any accidents, all distractions must be eliminated, such as cellular devices. Moreover, by eliminating all distractions, the safety of everyone on the road is increased\\n\\nAfter the realization of how dangerous the operation of a cellular device is while driving, more states started to amend laws against the action. As stated by the Governors Highway Safety Association, 47 out of 50 states and the District of Columbia have outlawed texting and driving.\\n\\nAs a consequence, violating the law can result in a large fine and even facing prison time depending on the state. The laws showed some form of effectiveness as the rate of traffic deaths among adults decreased.\\n\\nSome may argue that using a cellular device should be allowed on the pretense that the driver is using the device as a GPS. This, however, is not true. Even though the driver is using the device for navigation, the probability of an accident occurring when distracted is still 400%. The GPS defense will also be used as a justification for operating a phone while operating a vehicle. Through the form of loopholes, drivers will use the GPS excuse against police officers to avoid the ticket.\\n\\nThe different sides of texting and driving, whether to allow it or not, is an irrational debate. The debate between the sides is a debate between what is right and safe versus what is fun yet dangerous. Many laws and economic consequences have been set into place to avoid the death and destruction of using a cell phone while operating a vehicle that can take place. In addition, cell phone providers have also run campaigns against the lethal act. One example of a campaign from a cell phone provider is the It Can Wait campaign by AT&T where surveys were conducted among teenage users. During the AT&T It Can Wait campaign, a survey about the teenager\\'s views on texting and driving was conducted. Even though 97% of the teens that took the survey were aware that the usage of the device while driving was dangerous, 43% of them admitted to texting and driving despite that. While ignorance is bliss and most drivers highly doubt the possibility of an accident because of using a phone while driving, there is still a 400% chance of crashes occurring due to being distracted. Laws being passed to establish security among citizens are in vain due to the ignorance of people that do not care about the risks. They do not only put themselves in danger, but the driver is also responsible for the passengers, pedestrians, and the other people on the road.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Do Texting Bans Work?: Malcolm P.

       " \"A lot of people who drive their cars use their phones and don't know that it can seriously put you in danger. In a bad situation, you can die in a car crash for being on your phone. I am here to tell you why.\\n\\nHumans don't know that phones can seriously distract you from driving. While engaging in driving on the road, you can put other drivers in danger of you losing control and getting in a crash. You can not only kill yourself, but others on the road. Driving requires your full attention and being serious, not being on your cell phone. I suggest people who drive to make their important call/text before they get on their road.\\n\\nAccording to carsuance. net, there are over 40,000 car accidents per year. 33% of those deaths are from being irresponsible, including being on your cell phone. And the majority of those deaths are from humans who are in the age range of 16-20, typically people who aren't experienced drivers.\\n\\nWith the information I just shared, I think it proves it's very damaging to use a cell phone while in your car. So in conclusion, for all drivers out there, please do not use your phone and drive.   \",\n",
       " \"Every person has a phone. Every driver has a phone. Then when the drivers look at their phones is unsafe. People are glued to their phones and it's not healthy and not safe. The world would be a better place if we monitored our phone time and made it against the law it would a better and safer world.\\n\\nIt is unsafe for a driver to use a cell phone while driving. The distraction it causes for not only the driver but by the riders too is dangerous it could even be life threating. While operating a cell phone you lose focus on everything around you. So, we should monitor the places and times for people being on their phones.\\n\\nThe way it distracts a person is so unhealthy for your eyes and totally unsafe for you and your surroundings. How if you cannot pay attention in class on aa phone should you be able to drive. I personally believe phones shouldn't be able to be in the front parts of the car.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that you shouldn't be allowed on your phones while driving. Driving a car can be very dangerous, so we shouldn't be on our phones while driving. The way we look and on our phones is so unhealthy and dangerous.         \",\n",
       " \"CELL PHONES: The Killer Distraction\\n\\nWe live in a technical world, where cell phones are required accessories. Much like shoes, handbags, and clothes. If you're a technology geek you crave for the latest iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. Landline what is that? Extinct like the dinosaurs.\\n\\nCell Phones while a necessity for most are dangerous while driving. And have caused major accidents, some ending in death. That's why I refer to them as the killer distraction. Today's society is like a microwave. We want everything instant and ready to go. Most of us are always on the go and not without our cell phones. We can't seem to function without them. It is a mini computer in hand. But why we can't seem to stay off of them long enough while driving?\\n\\nHave you ever been driving, and another driver almost swerved into hitting you? Then you notice they're on their phone? You get so mad you want to chase them down. I had a friend who was on her cell phone while driving, drop it and end up hitting a fire hydrant. Now what if she had hit a person? She was ok that could have ended in a tragedy for herself or someone else.\\n\\nShould drivers be able to use cell phones while driving? I have mixed views on that. Cell phones are convenient in many ways. They have GPS to help navigate to desired destinations. Many of us would be lost without it. While driving you might receive an important call. But you can put it on speaker. Most of the newer cars have Bluetooth Speaker and you don't have to hold the phone. In my opinion that's safer, then phone in hand and the other on the wheel.\\n\\nNow on the other hand. Cell phones are the cause of many accidents which a even fatal . Distractions such as taking eyes the road just for a split second to send a text or to dial a number, can result in a accident. Having a heated argument or getting bad news while driving, can be a distraction a cause an accident. Trying to work GPS can be a distraction that could cause an accident. According to the internet there are 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 caused by texting and driving. It said that texting causes more accidents than drunk driving. Now that's serious and should be a wake up call. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in a fatal accident we're distracted from their cell phones.\\n\\nDue to the rising numbers in call accident regarding cell phones, most states ban the use of cell phone in hand, while driving. Cell phones is a killer distraction. And not safe to use while driving. Unless you're using your car's Bluetooth Speaker for hand free conversation. And that should be limited because it's still easy to get distracted. While driving we need to be focus on the road and our safety, and those around us. If you must make a call please use Bluetooth or even pull over. Texting while driving is dangerous and unacceptable. Let's not be the cause of another unnecessary accident.\\n\\n[Last Name] 2            \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nOne major impact on our society today is the usage of cell phones. So many people in the world today uses their cellular device on daily basis. Rather its usage is for an alarm clock, social media, or texting. People don't even like to have phone conversations anymore they just text that particular person they want to speak to their entire thoughts. Another major impact in today's society with these phones is driving and using them.\\n\\nTypically teens from the age of 16 to the adult age of approximately 25 are affected by texting and driving. These people affected by texting and driving are mainly because people feel like once they phone rings they must immediately See who their being texted by, called by, or any notified from on social media. Most of the time that's can cause you to have an accident, which also may lead up to a death. Many little distractions are putting other drivers, pedestrians, and yourself at risk of being in serious dangerous accident.\\n\\nIn conclusion I say all this to say that be a safe driver, always pay attention to the road and stay off your phone.   \",\n",
       " \"No Phones While Driving\\n\\nSmartphones, The devices of the future. With Phones you can: call people, watch movies, FaceTime, and much more. They have had a big impact on society and how we communicate. The main focus on phones was to make contact with people over large distances. However, people are now using phones While their driving and that can create complications.\\n\\nCalling or texting while on driving has become more of an issue since more are acquiring phones. The more phones come out the cheaper old ones are. That means more people are able to afford them which means a higher chance of a car crash (assuming they own a car).Some people own a car that has a bluetooth speaker that they can use to talk without having to put their hands on the phone. Of course this doesn't mean that a car crash is cant happen.\\n\\nCars with a built-in speaker should make driving easier but talking can still take focus away from the road. The road is one of the most important things for a driver (I'm not able to drive but I received help).Taking your eyes off it could very well end in the injury or death of several people.\\n\\nDid you know that nearly 1.25 million people die from car crashes in a year? That means we lose more than 3287 people per day.\\n\\nThere aren't any laws that say that driving with a phone is illegal but getting into a crash can get many killed and it is also treated as a murder. Meaning that phones while driving should be a crime in some states. It might seem petty to want to ban cell phones but the fact that so many deaths happen so often proves that this issue needs to be resolved. It would be hard to catch people on their phones while driving but with some type of technology it should be possible. With the current rates at which people die due to accident i believe that making a change should be a top priority.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Phones might be great and help out a lot but they can be the things that put you in your grave. This is a subject that could be completely overlooked but it's important to find a way to minimize all accidents and death. All life is important and trying to protect it should be a top goal for all of humanity.                  \",\n",

Distracted driving affects all drivers from time to time but can come with stiff consequences. Unfocused or distracted driving does not affect all drivers the same. Some frequently and to greater magnitudes pay less attention to the road, increasing their risk for disaster. However, it is important to note that it takes one time and perhaps the smallest of distractions to cause an accident.\\n\\nAlthough using your phone while driving can be deadly it can be useful. Using your phone to navigate can be very useful and find directions. It can also be used to play music and keep you entertained while driving. While these can be positive usage of your phone it can still be very negative.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and calling while driving can be deadly and should not be happening at all because it puts your own life and others.

Many people have become so reliant on their phone that they have built a tendency to use it whenever they can, or when they feel like it is ok to use it. People use their phones when they are out with family, friends, or when they are driving. Phones have become a menace to our safety on the road. Although, there are some drivers that are responsible when it comes to driving, that does not make the road any safer. Everyone still has a chance of getting into an accident with someone who was too busy on their phone while driving.\\n\\nPeople who use their phones while driving are part of the menace to our safety. People who use their phones while driving are distracted from what is happening around them. Some people are against phone usage while driving, but are the people who usually do it. People today do not usually commit to a cause because they believe it will never be achieved, so they just join in and start to not care of what might happen next. That is why laws on phone use while driving should be much harsher.\\n\\nThere are laws against phone usage in the United States, but that does not completely stop people from using their phone. Laws should be much stricter, and a bit of a bigger punishment.

This will result in accidents going down which would make the road a safer place for new drivers, and drivers in general.\\n\\nLaws on phone usage while driving should stricter.

       " \"Did you know that 26 percent of all motor vehicle crashes are related to the use of cell phones? Well, it's true! The level of danger related to the use of cell phones while driving is downright startling! The amount of distractions has drastically increased since the invention of cell phones. Not only do today's cell phones allow us to call, text, or chat at will, but they also give us access to hours of music and to interactive tools like GPS. Due to these capabilities, I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity.\\n\\nSmartphones have always made it easy for us to stay connected, but that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his/her text messages, emails, phone calls, or social media platforms while driving. A driver can travel the distance of a football field in the time that it takes for them to answer one text message! According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, each day about 11 teenagers die in car crashes caused by texting while driving.\\n\\nCar radios have always been a distraction to drivers, but the new advancements in smartphones gives us hours of music at our fingertips. We now can not only use music apps like Pandora or Spotify but we also can download endless amounts of music onto our smartphones. We can even use YouTube to listen to music videos! All of this music browsing not only distracts us from driving, but the volume level can also impair us from hearing approaching emergency vehicles traveling at high speeds.\\n\\nGone are the days of looking at paper maps. Today's cell phones all offer GPS to help drivers navigate in unknown areas. While this feature is very convenient and helpful, it can also lead to distractions while driving. Constant checking of the map on the screen to check where you are going keeps your eyes off of the actual road in front of you.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Even though today's cell phones offer us a lot of convenience, they also offer a lot of distractions. I hope with these bits of information, you'll make the right decision when you're on the road next. Answering that text message is not worth your life!             \",\n",

But, the majority of humans on this planet has a phone on them. Drivers should not have a phone in their disposal, no matter who it is. With deaths coming from young teen drivers, because we just have to look at our phone from: every phone call, or notification that vibrates in our pockets. We are humans who are still curious with the world around us, but with the mini-computer in our pockets we can see everything, with just a swipe of a tap or swipe of a finger. Now with drivers using their phone while driving, it will leave detrimental pain to families that are struck with the news that their son or family member is now dead. So, phones should never be used while driving, because drivers die from being distracted from their phone on the passenger seat or middle console.\\n\\nThe World Wide Web is a social area where everyone can connect and communicate. But it will distract the mind just as a man to a very attractive female, and be only fixated on the one subject for as long as they could. \"Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people.\"(http://www. donttextdrive. com) In the article it states that:\"Drivers\\n\\nWoodhouse 2\\n\\nneed to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices.\"(donttextdrive. com) Now with those facts, others would pull up that: what if is an important call? Or Someone was in danger, and the one to call is nowhere to be found? But that is no excuse to be distracted just for one text or call.\\n\\nTeens use their phone on an average of nine hours a day, just on social media and other apps they use. That more hours wasted on the news on in the morning, or time for studying for a test, or time to focus on the road to prevent an accident from happening. But teens aren\\'t known to the fact that they should watch the road and drive safely. Now and days the quote: \"At least 3,000 teens die each year from accidents caused by texting and driving, and another 300,000 are injured.\"(thezebra. com/insurance-news/76/teens-texting-and-driving) That\\'s too many deaths and it has increased over the years. Not excluding the adults but mainly, teens are on the phone the most for obvious reasons. That\\'s the reason why teens shouldn\\'t have their phone with them as they drive.\\n\\nAs you\\'re driving; you\\'re focused on one thing, that\\'s on the road and your destination. But if you have your phone in the passenger seat or in the middle console, and you hear the notification ringtone, then your off task on what you need to focus on. You will lose all concentration, even if you keep looking back and forth on the road and the phone.

       " 'Cell Phone Use While Driving\\n\\nCell phone use became widely available in the 1980\\'s. The drastic improvements in functionality and design caused the use of cell phones to increase tremendously over the last two decades, for billions of people worldwide. The primary reasons why cell phone usage increased so dramatically over the past two decades are essentially because they make communicating much easier, they enable you to contact people within seconds or minutes, regardless of whether they are thousands of miles away, in another country or just a few feet away, you can locate and access places quickly and more conveniently, and they can provide security. As a result of the improved functionality and design allows cell phones to operate like computers. Its vast improvements have created a pandemonium because unlike before, people are able to easily connect with loved ones, friends, and even meet new people through social media. Downloading apps to cell phones offers endless opportunities for communicating whether by email, face-time, text messaging, also conversations, scheduling planning/diet planner, internet surfing, and alarms, etc, are just a few features that are available. While these mini devices have become a key part of our daily lives offering huge advantages, equally they can have their disadvantages especially, when being used while driving a vehicle. The compulsive use of them is a distraction, resulting in many road accidents that have ended with very serious casualties.\\n\\nThe prevalent use of cell phones has made the task become like second nature. While this may be true, being capable of using a cell phone so adeptly while driving a vehicle has not prevented drivers from losing their focus. Habitual use of the cell phone has diminished the responsibilities of a driver\\'s who are supposed to constantly keep their eyes on the road, and their hands continuously on the steering wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) approximately 660,000 drivers were using their phones while driving behind the wheel during the daytime all told, a full 14% of fatal distracted driving crashes involved a cell phone that was in use at the time of the wreck (\"Deadly Distracted Driving Stats.\" DMV.ORG, 28 Apr. 2017). The National Safety Council reports that an estimated 1.6 million crashes a year are because of utilization of cell phones while driving. Although, most drivers support the ban of hand-held cell phone use and texting, majority admit to still doing it anyway. According to a AAA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgar Snyder & Associates, n. d. Web. 12 Dec).\\n\\nGeorgia\\'s new cell phone law, Hands-Free Driving, enacted Sunday, July 1st , 2018, was an imperative deterrent to reduce the number of fatal accidents, and loss of life for many innocent victims. Currently, forty-seven states have banned texting and driving, additionally, the 15 other states that have enacted the hands-free law, which requires drivers to use hands free technology, have seen fewer deaths and a 16 percent decrease in traffic fatalities in the two years after the law was enacted (\"House Bill 673- Hands-Free Law\"). Despite of the disadvantages or dangers of texting and driving, it does have a few advantages such as; navigation, provides help by making emergency contacts if in a dangerous situation and provides information about weather, traffic, or roadside accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, thousands of people are killed every day because of the distractions of these mini devices. This epidemic has become as serious as drinking under the influence. If drivers considered the risks and their responsibilities while being behind the wheel, they would adhere to the law by purchasing devices enabling them to be hands free when using a cell phone. Whatever text or phone call that pops up on the screen of their phones can wait.

       " 'Phones, iPhones, Androids, so many different devices to be distracted by. We seen a huge jump in vehicle accidents due to our technological advances in cars and phones. Today\\'s world is such a dangerous place, especially on the roads. People have to be one hundred percent focused on the road to avoid accidents, sadly people have ignored the clear warning signs.\\n\\nMore than 1,500 people have died in car accidents in Georgia in 2016 alone. Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have increased in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past few years.\\n\\nThese deaths jumped by a third from 2014 to 2016 in Georgia.\\n\\nAs more people do it they become comfortable and trusting in the car, but sadly it\\'s more than that. People are also addicted to phones, social media, and the constant search of \"making it\". They are yet to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Operating a mobile device should not be allowed.\\n\\nPhones are the main thing today that are causing problems in our society. They distract and hook people in. It has a great purpose but used improperly by most of us. As many studies show, we ARE distracted by them and should be prohibited to use while operating a vehicle. AT&T mademany advertisements that said \"It can wait\" referring to the use of phones.\\n\\nCitations https://www. ajc. com/news/local/deaths-due-distracted-driving-rising-georgia/jpJciD8TbtqoPaCCR3ynQM/   ',\n",
       " 'Unhealthy texting and driving\\n\\nTeens and young adults today love texting and being on technology. Technology is a great way to communicate with fellow friends and family. However, there are times where people should put phones down and focus to protect the safety of others. People should not use the phone while driving and on the job while working.\\n\\nPeople should always have the phone put up while driving.\\n\\nIt is very dangerous and unsafe to text and drive. When it comes to texting and driving, teens are more likely to be found doing this. Every teen should have the phone away from them and should only use it when they are at a complete stop and parked.\\n\\nPeople should not be driving distracted when other passengers lives are in their hands. When others are in the car, it is crucially important for the driver to focus and maintain their driving on the road. Passengers should also make sure they use their seat belt and make sure the driver is focused to ensure their own safety.\\n\\nTeens are not the only ones texting and driving, young adults are just as worst. Young adults have jobs that call them while they are on the road, which causes a big distraction. Young adults and teens combined are a series of added wrecks and deaths. Deaths due to texting and driving continues to rise. The death toll could easily be lowered if people would just not text and drive.\\n\\nThere would be less deaths and car wrecks from distracted driving.\\n\\nWhen it comes to texting and driving, it is a major issue for truck drives. Truck drivers are far worse than teens and adults in their cars. Most drivers wear headsets to communicate while on the road. Headsets are more safe for truck drivers to use instead of having their phone in hand and lose control of the wheel.\\n\\nWhen drivers wreck, there are huge consequences. Passengers that are in the vehicle and others involved in the accident have the opportunity to sue or charge the driver. Drivers should always think of the consequences of what will happen if they pick up their phone, lose control, and wreck with people in the car. Drivers should also be off their technology even when they are alone riding safety is number one priority which is why phones should not be used driving.              ',\n",
       " \"Phones And Driving\\n\\nCell Phones are one of the essential items in many of peoples lives. We use them everywhere from looking up your favorite song, everyday news etc. but people are so used to them that they do not realize the dangers that come with it. In this article you will read about the dangers of phones and driving with them. We'll talk about overall what is distracted driving, the dangers that come with it and lastly why you should just put it down.\\n\\nDid you know over a 1000 people a day are injuried from driving distracted by their phones, yeah not a lot of people either. Many people do not realize the real danger they face when they take their eyes of the road for just a second to change that song. It is a problem many drivers face even when they know its a problem. Many people have grown this into such a habit that it feels almost as second nature to them and don't realize in the moment what they're doing.\\n\\n1 out of 4 people injuried in a car wreck are said to have been texting and driving. We don't realize how something can affect us before it is too late, whether you just swerve of the road a little bit or hit a tree you realize what you did in the end. When you get behind that wheel you are already putting yourself at risk many people do not realize that roads are one of the dangerous places to be, but when you decide it is time to change that song you put yourself at a significantly higher risk than before.\\n\\n94% of drivers support banning texting and driving. Texting and driving is a problem everywhere and where they're are many people against it they're are still many people whom do not see a problem with it. When you pick up that phone you are not only putting yourself but others at risk too. I want you to ask yourself this is that sing important enough or that funny text from someone to risk your life over. Many people will say no but many people are hypocritical. You never believe something will happen to you until it does and when it does there is only one person you can blame.\\n\\nYou read about the affects and what using your phone while driving can do. Just take the advice from the many people who went through the affects of what this act can do because they know it better than anybody. Next time you get behind that wheel ask yourself, how risky to I want to be today?\\n\\n1            \",\n",
       " \"Should or should not drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Some people strongly feel that under no circumstances should a person be allowed to use their phone, and there are others who feel there is nothing wrong with using your phone in your vehicle if it is used responsibly. I strongly agree that drivers shouldn't be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nI can honestly say that I have seen multiple people get in real bad car accidents while looking at their phone. Even my own sister got into an accident because she wouldn't stay off her phone. I think banning cell phone usage in a car while driving is good. Having cell phones while driving isn't safe for others or yourself while driving. It can cause accidents, killing a lot of people, and possibly killing yourself over a text message , a silly video, or a phone call. That's why there is a law that says, it's illegal to drive and text at the same time, or hold your phone to your ear while driving.\\n\\nThe law basically says a person cannot have a phone in their hand or on any part of their body like their leg or arm or stomach to support a phone. A person can only use their phones to make or get phone calls if they use speakerphone, earpiece, wireless headphones or the phone is connected to the vehicle or electronic watch. The\\n\\nHands-Free Georgia Act started July 1, 2018.\\n\\nThere are alternatives to holding your phones, Businesses are creating hands free phone holders, with many different styles to appeal to all.. The hands free phone holder can be put on your windshield on the left side of your wheel.\\n\\nI also feel that with the distractions that cell phones cause while driving, which can turn into accidents, end up costing a person money, because of the damage from the car wrecks that may happen. Car Insurances are taking a lot of your money because of damaging other cars while texting and driving. The accidents also make your insurance increase which is more money out of your pocket. There is also the possibility of receiving several tickets as well for using your cell phone while driving, which is more money gone.\\n\\nThere should be a lesson learned, which is no hand held talking while driving, no texting and driving and no social media and driving, not to cause accidents. Their is no way that you should be answering your phone while driving, let it go to voicemail or call them back later. For those who care about others don't text and drive at the same time. Keep others safe and your loved ones together. Abbied by the rules follow direction then you will never ever have to pay for any damages or worry about any injuries or death.   \",\n",
       " \"Title: Phones and Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I personally think people should not use their phone and drink. Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and accidents. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. Aside from the statistics of numbers of crashes, deaths and injuries, here are some graphics that can show you just what it is you're doing when you choose to text and drive, why it is so dangerous, and what can be done to prevent it.\\n\\nWhen using your phone and driving at the same time it can be very dangerous to you, the passengers in the car and other drivers around you. Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you're texting and driving.\\n\\nIf you're traveling at fifty-five mph, then that means you will drive the length of a football field without looking at the road.\\n\\nA person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.\\n\\nMost drivers think they can multitask by sending a quick message or reading a quick message. Seventy-one percent of teens and young people say they have composed or sent SMS messages while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Seventy-eight percent of teens and young adults say they have read an SMS message while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Text messages makes a car crash up to twenty-three times more likely to happen.\\n\\nA big part of the problem is that people don't think it's a problem. Seventy-seven of young adults are very or somewhat confident that they can safety text while driving.\\n\\nFifty-five of young adult's drivers claim it's easy to text while driving. But it is a problem, teens and adults who text while driving spend approximately ten percent of their driving time outside of their lane.\\n\\nTexting and driving or even using your phone while driving is very dangerous.\\n\\nDespite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks. Take the pledge to stop texting and driving.                                                   \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nI say we should not be allowed to use cell-phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Because according to today\\'s research most accidents are caused by the use of cell-phones while driving. I honestly believe if more people stop using cell-phones while driving, it wouldn\\'t be as many accidents as there is in today\\'s society. After doing research it says \" drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash\" and that is because of cell-phones. Also, when you are driving and using your phone it distracts from what\\'s going on around you.\\n\\nIn the United States they have a law that if you are on your phone while driving you can get a ticket or furthermore get arrested.\\n\\nNow that they have passed that law i rarely see people use their phones while driving. Over the past couple of decades the use of phones while driving was the main cause of accidents. \"Driver distraction, a sub-category of inattention, has been estimated to be a contributing factor in 8% to 13% of all crashes\". When people get into accidents its alot that can happen like injuries, the insurance companies, and other people may be in the car with them. Before we try to stop letting people use their phones while driving they say it\\'s a lot of other things that distract drivers as well like eating, arguing, listening to music, and yelling at other drivers.\\n\\nHowever, i believe most drivers use cell-phones may be having important calls from family, or co-workers saying they need you to fill in for them. I can personally say i\\'ve had personal experiences with someone using a cell-phone with me in the car. My grandma she was pulling in to my uncle\\'s church and she was trying to call someone and she hit a block that was holding a stop sign and it messed up the front of her car. Another one is my mom she was driving and she was swerving in and out of lanes and she almost ran into a pickup truck. I have many more but im just praying that everyone leaves driving with phones in 2018 because i don\\'t want any harm coming to me or anybody else i know.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we all as a community and globally we should restrict from using cell-phones while operating a vehicle. This year i don\\'t plan on experiencing any vehicle accidents because of someone on their phone while driving. So i iree\\' miller say NO to phones while driving.          ',\n",
       " 'Phones and driving\\n\\nThe National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. That\\'s out of control. America has an addiction problem, and it\\'s all about cell phones. You see ads on tv, on your phone, on billboards, pretty much everywhere, and they are taking american lives.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of problems phones bring to the table, but Americans getting distracted by them is one of the most common causes of death in the us. One quick peek at your phone and suddenly there\\'s a semi truck coming at you 100 miles per hour. It can happen in almost an instant. And the numbers are there to back it up! There is no way more than 25% of the people killed per year expected or saw the crash coming.\\n\\nThe government has taken slow action, creating the \"hands-free\" law. This law makes it illegal to touch your phone while driving at all, but it isn\\'t exactly being enforced. Sure, cops are now allowed to arrest people for touching their phone, but it just made people hide their phone better while driving, which honestly causes more accidents.\\n\\nThere are so many ways to fix this problem. For example, apple could make a feature where when your phone is moving above a certain speed, your phone locks itself until you have stopped moving. While Apple has a feature like this, it\\'s easily avoidable as there\\'s a button on the screen that opens your iphone.\\n\\nI hope these essays give you a reason not to touch your phone while driving. It\\'s just seconds before you realize what\\'s happening, and there\\'s no going back when you cant even see what\\'s coming. It takes little to no effort to put down your phone, and the same amount of effort to stop yourself from picking it up. Drive safe!   ',\n",
       " 'Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. New phones are coming out so more and more people are buying phones. Almost all people that operate a vehicle have a cell phone. Drivers should not operate a cell phone while driving.\\n\\nDrivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because texting and driving can lead to bad accidents. According to research last year over one million accidents happened in the united states in 2018. Texting and driving is very distracting to drivers on the road. Many states have made this illegal but all states need to crack down on this so the accidents will go down in the future.\\n\\nTexting and driving can also lead to death. The rate of death is very high for texting and driving every year it causes up to half a million deaths. The death rate is so high because people are careless about being on their phone while driving. They risk the chance of hurting others because of their bad habits.\\n\\nTexting and driving is very dangerous because it leads to bad accidents and deaths. Drivers should stop doing it and police need to crack down on drivers that do it. If this happens accidents while driving would dramatically decrease and deaths would decrease. Texting and driving should stop, and we can make that change.   ',\n",
       " \"In my very honest opinion, phones should not be allowed to use while driving. There are so many reasons why they shouldn't. There could be children in the car. Also, getting stopped by the police is everybody's worst dream. Lastly, it's not safe.\\n\\nTo begin with, texting and driving could be extremely dangerous when kids are in the car. First, while somebody is using their phone while driving, it could cause a big accident if they aren't paying attention to what's going on in front of them. There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.\\n\\nMoreover, everyone knows getting stopped by the police isn't the best thing. The tickets cost a lot on money and sometimes is very hard to pay. Even some police may be harsh and might even take you in to court. Nobody wants to get stopped and pay for the price.\\n\\nIn addition, texting and driving is obviously not safe. Every year, at least 200,000 people experience accidents caused by texting while behind the wheel. The way the number keep increasing is honestly awful and so sad. I'm hoping that more in the future the number will decrease rather then increasing.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I have made my point that texting and driving is no where near acceptable. There is accident after accident each month & dealing with a loss is very sad. Not only can it affect whoever is in the car, but it can also affect those around.       \",\n",
       " 'Cell phones have been a great innovation to society and mankind overall, however could these great devices be causing us harm? We have become so very dependent on our cell phones and always being connected that we cannot seem to put them down. Times such as when we are driving or something as simple as a family dinner just is not the same anymore, we are always communicating in some way however not with those who matter most. We sit down at the dinner table and do not talk with our families but our \"friends\" on social media. Not being able to separate our connection with our phones, laptops, tablets, etc. is potentially hurting us by never being able to step away from our devices. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. According to www. edgarsynder. com \"Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that\\'s enough time to travel the length of a football field.\" We all are aware of the dangers of texting and driving yet many many of us still do it, myself included. I am torn between the practicality and the legality of the situation. My state of Georgia has a \"hands free\" law. Meaning your phone cannot be in use or on your person in any way, shape, or form.\\n\\nAt least Twenty four states have hand held or texting and driving bans in the United States. Montana is the only state with no ban whatsoever.\\n\\nIn my personal opinion there should be texting bans for everyone in all states and be allowed to talk on the phone if they please.                  ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nTechnology has taken the world to new heights in numerous ways. The invention of cars being able to take us places quicker than a horse proved that anything could happen. Mobile phones grew just as popular and took over the world with their unfathomable functions, designs, and capabilities. The way that people are so heavily into their phones and the problem with not having good drivers on the road or when those are combined make driving a combo that no one wants to see.\\n\\nThe usage of phones should not be allowed while driving by any means necessary. Phones divert people's focus and show that we are easily engrossed in them, being sidetracked is one of the things that are not needed on the road. The distractions of phones cause people to bump into things from household to public and it shows that staring at a phone is too much for most humans to multitask.\\n\\nIf a phone is needed for directions, then it should be set before driving or placed upon a stand of some sort on the dashboard of the car so that looking down for a long period of time does not lead to danger. In addition, texting can be held off and can be answered by simply pulling over to check rather than be a hazard on the road by taking either one or two hands off of the steering wheel.\\n\\nUsing a phone while driving has caused many to be severely injured or has led to the death of the driver, passengers, the people in the other vehicle, and/or unsuspecting pedestrians. There is no justifiable reason for someone to use their phone, the lives of few or many can be affected by someone's foolish actions. Others should not have to pay the price of someone else's actions by suffering from serious injuries, losing someone they love, or even worse their life.\\n\\nIn summary, the temptation to use a phone while driving should be taken away by turning the phone upside down or turning the phone off until the destination is reached, a music playlist should already be made in advance so that skipping an unwanted song does not happen. Commercials and ads should be increased and tell the consequences in a slightly harsher way and to get people to truly understand how much people value their life just as much as they do theirs. Phones should be needed to connect to cars to turn the phone off or through that way people tell of the message that is received. All in all, people should just stop using their phones while driving and should just think about others around them.\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nMany people can argue that using a phone in any capacity while driving should not be allowed. However, it can also be argued that it is useful because phones can come in handy if your car were to break down if you could use the \"hands-free\" options and when it is used as a tracking device. Many people can argue that using phones are unsafe while driving but that is not necessarily true. You need to make sure that you use your phone wisely while driving, use it correctly and for the right reasons. There are many situations where phones should be allowed when driving especially when it comes to your safety.\\n\\nFirstly, a reason why using your phone while driving is that it could be useful to make calls if your car has a problem or if you are in danger. If I were to be in an unsafe situation like if my car were to break down, and I did not have my phone with me, I would not have had a way to notify someone and get help in time. I would have to ask a stranger to use their phone, which could in fact put me in more danger since I would be putting my life in someone else\\'s hands.\\n\\nThere are many apps on your phone that can help you in any situation you may get into like, \"Apps like iWrecked allow you to store and access all pertinent information, send a report, and access emergency resources with great ease and efficiency\"(School). There is also a crash detecting ability that comes with the app Life 360 just in case of an accident, \"Crash detection uses patented technology to detect major collisions. It relies on sensors in your phone, like your accelerometer and GPS, to detect a significant impact whenever the vehicle is moving over 25 mph\"(life). A lot of apps now don\\'t even require you to press or swipe at anything to use them while driving.\\n\\nAlso, with the new hands-free accessories available, there is less danger involved since you are able to be less distracted since you are paying more attention to the road. \"Researchers analyzed accident and traffic citations for college students who claimed to use hands-free phones and those who used handheld devices in general. Both types of students were equally likely to wind up in car accidents. However, study participants with hands-free devices did receive fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than those with ordinary cell phones\"(Housely).\\n\\nYou can use your phone as long as it doesn\\'t interfere with your driving. \"A hands-free mobile phone can minimize such issues, allowing drivers to make calls without ever taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the steering wheel\"(Housely). Another reason why hands free is a good idea is because there is a way for people to utilise their mobiles without looking at it while driving. Not only are phones easier to use with hands-free options, but they also can help you before you even swipe it open.\\n\\nIf I am ever in the need to go meet someone in a place that I\\'ve never been and I do not have access to a phone, I will not have a tracking device on me in case I get lost or someone is trying to get a hold of me in case there is no service. Although the phone may not have service, the tracker will allow my family to know where I am. This tracker isn\\'t just useful for me it is also useful for my parents to know exactly where I am. Now there are different apps and programs available on most phones that help with tracking such as Life 360 and Find My iPhone. In life 360 there is also some sort of detection, and it helps when you\\'ve been in any sort of accident. \"Life360 crash detection is an automated service that knows when you\\'ve been in an accident, either as a driver or passenger, and asks if you\\'re ok. If help is needed or you don\\'t respond, life 360 will notify your circle members and emergency contacts on your behalf and share your exact location,\"(life). This way they will have a location on me in case something happens. If you do not bring your phone, everyone would be searching for hours. In another instance, if I would not have access to a phone while I was being followed by someone, I would not be able to call the proper authorities to get help fast. On the apple website itself, it gives you brief information and you can install it, \"Apple receives this location information only when you locate your device, turn on Lost Mode, or enable Send Last Location. Location data is only retained for 24 hours so we can display the last known location of your device. Find My iPhone also automatically turns on Activation Lock, which requires your Apple ID to be entered before anyone can erase or reactivate your device\"(Apple).\\n\\nIn conclusion, there were examples of different situations as to why phones should be allowed while driving. In the first example I explained how a phone would be handy when there is a car emergency. I also talked about how using the phone while driving can become less distracting when there is a hands-free option. And for safety reasons, there is a way for anyone to be tracked, if you are in danger. The majority of people think that not using your phone while driving is a better idea for safety reasons. These are a few reasons why driving with a phone at any capacity would be a lot more beneficial.\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\nSchool, driving\"Pros And Cons Of Using A Hands-Free Mobile Phone While Driving.\"\\n\\nElite Driving School, Maryland driving school, 3 Nov. 2014, drivingschool.net/pros-and-cons-of-using-a-hands-free-mobile-phone-while-driving/.\\n\\nHousley, Sharon. \"10 Things Your Phone Can Do in Emergency Situations.\" SMS and Text Messaging Blog, Mar. 2020, www.notepage.net/learning-center/10-things-your-phone-can-do-in-emergencies.htm.\\n\\nApple, the company. \"Privacy - Control.\" Apple, Apple Inc, 2020, www.apple.com/privacy/control/#:~:text=Find%20My,iCloud%20on%20a%20new%20de vice.\\n\\n360, life. \"Feel Free, Together.\" Life360, Https://Www.driverknowledge.com/, www.life360.com/.

An example would be texting and driving, this has caused many deaths for a lot of teens and ruined others\\' lives because of It. A reason why teens text and drive are they don\\'t see the consequences for it. Another would be They are always in a hurry to give information and the last reason is Teen\\'s nowadays are hook to their phones and don\\'t have patience to wait. These are some reasons why teens text and drive and there should be a way to stop them from using it and I believe there\\'s a way to prevent it.\\n\\nOne way to prevent this is by putting your phone out of reach this way you don\\'t get distracted by the text messages and notifications that pop up. Another way is putting your phone on do not disturb this causes your messages to make a noise and don\\'t show anything but only emergency calls. If your using your phone for GPS than its best to mount it on the dashboard. Last would be committed to not using your phone while driving and learn the consequences to it. If people knew the risk of using their phones while driving and how many people have lost their life to it, they would think twice in one article it talked about why not too and therefore and here\\'s is why.\\n\\nIn this article written by Lauren Bennet named 10 fact of texting and driving she states the \"People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated\". This goes to show how its more dangerous than being intoxicated while driving. There\\'s a lot more to this article like how 520 pedestrians are hit each year by a person using their phone or how 64% of accidents are from being distracted by a phone. A lot can be said about this article and there\\'s a lot of problems that can be prevented and there actually is in some states there actually making it illegal to use your phones while driving. An example of one in Georgia.\\n\\nIn Georgia we are not allowed to text and there are no restrictions on handheld cell use for anyone else. In other places like Alabama teens that are 16 or 17 that have had their license less than a year are the only ones not allowed to use their phones. Another would be in Connecticut All handheld cell use and texting is banned. Each state is different, but this has caused a difference and has caused less crashes and should be in forced in many other places. This can make a changed and help teens grow to their fullest and enjoy their youth from one small mistake with a big consequence.                                            ',\n",

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating any vehicles. Using a phone is not safe for the driver or if applicable any passengers that are in the vehicle.\\n\\nWhile driving a cell phone is a distraction. When operating a motor vehicle your full attention needs to be in the vehicles , the surrounding of the vehicle, and the road ahead. A cell phone is an immediate distraction to a driver because their focus shifts. If a driver receives a text and is able to read it their attention and eyes are now at their phone an not on the road which can cause a accident involving another vehicle with passengers in it or simply an accident with them and the passengers they have with them.\\n\\nIf people are able to use phones while driving it would increase the accident rates , slow down traffic , and cause more deaths and injury's. Driving requires your full attention and awareness. You need to always be aware when your driving and if your focus is on your phone your now not focused on the road.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving not only is putting everybody on the roads life at risk but yours to. The accident would put you At-Fault whether you get injuries or not and therefore it would be a lot of damages you would have to pay for , especially if you were in a wreck with another vehicle or possibly multiple vehicles.\\n\\nHaving phones while driving isn't safe for the driver , passengers or any other moving vehicles on the roads. Using phones while driving is dangerous and should be illegal and people that take action in this crime should be strictly punished.   \",\n",
       " \"PHONES AND DRIVING\\n\\nThis world is stuck on cell phones, no attention span. People use cellphones more than they use their brain, which could lead to death or serious injuries. In this essay im going to tell you how the use cellphones while driving can lead to death or serious injuries.\\n\\nPeople use cellphones to much and don't even see the world around them. Too much use of cell phones can harm your brain and can cause massive headaches. Now imagine driving with a headache that can cause a wide range of aggression and pain. That can also lead to a car accident. People don't understand that their life is at risk when it comes to using cellphones while driving.\\n\\nDistracted while driving can lead to death or injuries. That's why the majority of people find ways to be safe and comfortable on the road. In the beginning of january 2010 there was a commercial driver constantly using his cell phone on the job. One day he was on his cellphone and wasn't paying attention to the road. He rammed into the back of a woman's car who was trying to merge onto the highway and killed her. He admitted to texting when he hit her car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finds that texting while driving is the most dangerous and alarming while driving. You could lose your life texting while driving and also to being distracted while driving.\\n\\nIn everyday life there is someone breaking the law to texting and driving. It can also put fear into people's heart who is not doing it, because you can end their life as well. I just wanted to let you know to please be cautious on the road. I lost my aunt to someone who was texting while driving. She was the sweetest person I know. Please can all citizens put their phone down while they are driving.    \",\n",
       " 'Do you believe that drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. I think that drivers should not be allowed to operate a cellular device while driving a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving can cause a series of accidents and drivers wouldn\\'t have their full attention on the road. The roads would be more safe, if drivers don\\'t use cellphones while driving.\\n\\nMost tragic car accidents are nearly caused by drivers using their cellphones. Studies show that fatal car accidents by teen drivers comes from them being distracted by their \"phones\". This is a very high percentage , considering that there are also adults that rarely text and drive then get into an accident. If we are to be more descriptive, \"In 2017, 15,341 drivers aged 15-29 were involved in fatal crashes due to distraction or cell phone use.\" The more that young adults aren\\'t exposed to the rights and wrongs of texting and driving, that percentage will rise. This is a serious risk factor, that could be elevated to the percentage that will cause the limits on cars to rise.\\n\\nAnother con when it comes to cellphone use while driving is the excessive use of \"iphone holders\". It may seem harmless, but in all reality, it can cause young adults, even adults and elders, to be at risk of an accident. What happens is that although the phone holder is put in place for people to see and interact with their phones without taking their eyes off the road, it is still seen as a temptation. For example, if an 18 year old is about to drive at a party, and is receiving multiple messages., while her phone holder is in place constantly seeing the message pop up, could lead to anticipation, and a risk, that could\\'ve been avoided. There are many ways that driving can be safe, without heading your phone!\\n\\nSince I stand for less cellphone usage while driving, here are some of my personal tips that may help prevent not only young adults, but everyone from risking their lives. There is now built-in technology that can pick up your voice, activate GPS, and even reply to messages; It\\'s called siri ! Siri is an apple product that is built within the Iphone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this is why I believe texting and driving is not safe for anyone. We could save more lives if we put everything down. With this type of technology, it would make it easier to access things while you are on the road, and will, in the long run, will decrease the risk of accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this is why I stand for young adults, even adults alone, should not use their cellular devices while driving. We shouldn\\'t have to put our lives at risk for one simple text.   ',\n",
       " \"Driving essay\\n\\nI believe that people shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any kind of capacity while driving because not only is it bad but, it's also dangerous for you and whoever else is in the car with you.\\n\\nTransporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed.\\n\\nMany brands of new cars are equipped with technology that connects your cell phone to your vehicle's stereo system. If you drive an older model vehicle, invest in a cell phone with Bluetooth technology and voice recognition technology that will allow you to send and receive messages hands-free. The reason why I am saying this is because if you could speak to your phone to do things it would be easier for you to drive on the road.\\n\\nEveryone already knows how bad it is to text and drive and that it can cause accidents, but I never told you how many there has been. In 2011, 1.3 million automobile accidents were caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident.\\n\\nAfter all the bad things that can happen, I believe that nobody should be allowed to use cell phones while doing any operating in a vehicle. Also, in 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers using cell phones on U.S. roads. The bottom line is that texting and driving is seriously dangerous so put the down the phone. Keep your eyes on the road and stay safe.             \",\n",
       " \"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive has a cell phone. Some states have made it illegal to use your phone while driving. Operating a cell phone while driving can be dangerous for several different reasons.\\n\\nDrivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because it is dangerous for other drivers and it put their life in jeopardy. It's a proven known fact that most wrecks happen because the driver not looking at the rode. And if you're looking down at your phone texting it's no way you're looking at the rode, an that's serious because you could put your life in danger. So just put your phone up and be safe.\\n\\nBut if you have a bluetooth device it's all good because your still paying attention to the rode. But if you're not a skilled driver or been driving for a long time its your best bet not to even use a bluetooth device, because you could be in a conversation on the phone an lose focus.\\n\\nReports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because drivers text while driving and they don't wear a seat belt. So put those phone s down an put your seat belt on and drive safe.                    \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers be able to use their cell phone?\\n\\nWith the popularity of mobile devices rising year after year many cellphone users attempt to use their devices while driving. As a result of this there are 1.6 million cell phone use related car accidents each year. Making a call, sending a text, or skipping a song is never worth putting someones life in danger. It is simply too dangerous for a multitude of reasons and never should be done. If drivers were able to do this the roads would never be safe.\\n\\nCell Phones are extremely distracting whether your doing your homework, watching tv, and especially while operating a motor vehicle. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field. Hundreds of thousands of injuries occur each year as a result of distracted driving. To stop this problem we have to do more than just bring awareness to the issue, we have to steps legally to protect teen drivers as well as adults.\\n\\nTeens are most at risk for distracted driving related accidents. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. Also with only one other person in the car teen drivers are twice as likely to get into a fatal car crash. This is due to the fact that teens use cell phones more than adults and are also more easily distracted. Most drivers are aware of the fact that texting and driving is very dangerous but continue to do so anyway. The desire to want to stay connected at all times is too great for us citizens to restrict ourselves. So we have to put laws in place to restrict cell phone usage while driving. Some states already have laws prohibiting holding your cell phone in your hand while you drive. We need these laws every where or we will continue to lose loved ones to car accidents that could have been avoided if the drivers weren't using their cell phones.                                  \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving is No Bueno\\n\\nPhones and driving have been around or influenced in our society for a very long time. Fatal injuries of friends, families, or even fellow class mates have been a victim to this incident. We have the option to say no more! Why wouldn\\'t the state governments all throughout the U.S. want to induce a law such as this in each state? For certain we could create a major decrease in the percentages of car crashes for our citizens. Think of when you are walking, you don\\'t stare into your phone because you will bump into other people walking, so why would you do that while driving? Therefore, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics.\\n\\nThere are roughly about more than one hundred thousand people who are involved with phones while driving. For example, Mississippi has banned texting and driving, but has yet to ban holding the phone in their hand while driving. Now think to yourself, what are the chances of someone responding to a hilarious text from their friend? Deep down I believe anyone\\'s answer would be a high chance. The moment you take focus off the road even if it\\'s for half of a second, you increase your chance of being able to miss something causing you to make a horrible judgment call on the road. A quarter percent of car crashes is due to the usage of a cellphone. We should have the encouragement to change that quarter into a penny or no chance at all!\\n\\nHow much do you value your life? Even if your answer to that is \"Not much at all.\", what about someone you cherish and that cherishes you? People tend to do more for others over themselves. Also, passengers of your vehicle aren\\'t the only ones that you are accountable for. That\\'s right; think of the pedestrians who tend to use their feet as transportation. You have a high chance of endangering them if you take your focus from the road and onto your phone. Even if no one matters to you and all that\\'s in value to you is money, you\\'re still in for a rude awakening. If you think insurance is a burden to you and your financial life right now just think about how a citation for texting and driving will affect you. Think about your life and how multiple areas of it can potentially be affected by a poor action to use your phone while driving.\\n\\nWhat most people don\\'t know is that the mind is trained to do one thing at a time in the result of having controlled and efficient focus. Imagine how the usage of a phone can take your mind from what is in front of you on the road. You mentally must be in a good state to perform safe driving. Teen drivers can be affected by this heavily. Due to a little amount of experience of driving. One more thing that can affect their driving is social media and how it is excessively used in today\\'s generation. Last thing parent\\'s want is a phone call stating that their kid has been in a car accident. We could simply all agree on this.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics as we stated above. We have a huge percentage of human beings that are affected by this distraction. We need to take away the cause, so the effect ceases. High values are at a major risk if you make the mistake to use your phone while driving. So, the next time you drive, take your values into consideration. You need to take full control of your focus and create a great, determined, and powerful state while driving. Don\\'t get caught up in this distraction, it isn\\'t urgent while you are driving, get to your destination safely first!   ',\n",

For example, what if someone crashes and kills one of your family member just because they were on their phones or you crash into someone because you were on your phone you would feel bad for the person you crash and the reason was for being on your phone you might end just getting arrested. This shows, that no matter whenever you are driving you should keep your eyes on the road something can easy cause a accident so fast. This is important because, now they have made a new aw about if a police sees you with a phone on your hand while driving you will get ticket or get arrested just to prevent an accident.

       " \"Dangers of texting while driving\\n\\nI believe that drivers should not use their phones while operating a vehicle. Everyday people are dying in car accidents because they're using their phones while driving. Many people today believe that cell phones are one of the most leading factors in car accidents. Despite the fact that they're putting themselves in danger, people still use their phone while driving because they don't want to miss anything and to contact others. Are people's texting conversations that important, that they risk crashing their car, or putting not only your life but the life of other people at risk.\\n\\nNot only is texting or talking behind the wheel bad enough, but many people compare this to drinking and driving as well. Drunk driving is another leading factor in car accidents everyday. These two things are closely related to each other because of how many injuries or deaths they both have caused. Some say that texting while driving is even more dangerous than drunk driving, but people still don't realize the danger of it.\\n\\nMany people argue that having a bluetooth will make it easier for them to stay on the phone while staying focused on the road while driving. they also say that it's more useful to them. But that can also distract them from the road as well, they could be in a very important conversation that can cause them to lose focus of what they're doing and they could end up in a bad car wreck. If the phone call or text is that important, than they should take time to pull over into a parking lot so they can answer it instead of trying to answer it in the car. Most people believe that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road but it really isn't.\\n\\nAnd even though there are laws that ban the use of cell phones while driving it hasn't stopped the amount of car crashes every day. The government can put a law to ban the use of phones while in the car, but they can't stop People from using it because it's not as easy for police to see when people are on their phones as it is for them to determine how fast you are going or headlights are off. People just don't see the use in banning phones and don't follow them.\\n\\nI personally feel like people should stop using their phones as well and stay focused. If people truly want to stay safe then there are plenty of ways of doing this like putting their phones on silent and not on vibrate. They can also turn their phones completely off. And if they can do that it will at least lessen all the crashes. When you're behind the wheel, you should never have your attention on your cell phone. It's important to be alert at all times. You should always keep your eyes on the road.\\n\\n1            \",\n",

While most people do know the risks that come with texting and driving it doesn't stop them. the reasons people keep texting and driving they don't think they will get caught they think they are good enough to not get caught so they keep doing it. In some ways, the reason people get drunk and drive are similar to the people who text and drive. They get away with it once and think it wasn't so bad so they do it again and sooner or later get caught. Distracted Driving The Center for Disease Control (CDC) points out that there are three types of distraction we are susceptible to while driving. They are visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions consist of anything that pulls your eyes away from focusing on the road. Manual distractions happen when you remove a hand or both hands from the steering wheel Cognitive distractions involve things that draw your mind away from the road and makes you lose focus. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes on a yearly basis while texting while driving is six times more likely to cause a crash than drunk driving is. And no one gets that when you text and drive your not only risking your life your risking everyone around you. Text messaging while operating a motor vehicle prohibited for persons under 21 and for commercial vehicle operators. This is a Primary Law, which means that the driver can receive a ticket for the violation without other traffic violations taking place if you are using a hands-free phone kit, or your car comes with Bluetooth connectivity which allows your audio system to connect to your phone directly you are allowed to use your phone.. However, you are not allowed to hold the phone while you are driving. Therefor texting and driving is highly against the law and u are not allowed to do it whatsoever.   \",\n",
       " 'Many people feel the need to check their cellular device while behind the wheel of a vehicle. Although many people own and operate cellphones on a daily basis, they shouldn\\'t use cellphones while operating a vehicle because it is a hazard for everyone. To begin with, it causes a distraction to those driving and others who are also on the road. If any lights come on for notifications, others may stray their eyes to see what is flashing in their mirrors or next to them which could cause an accident to occur on the roadway. Everyone needs to stay focused on where they\\'re driving so no mishaps occur. Even if there is a stop in traffic, people need to be wary of their surroundings since it could start moving at any time. Everyone nowadays is curious about their phones, almost everyone always has a cellular device on them which causes a \"need\" to be pay so much attention to their pockets. Although many may want to have their phones on hand, it isn\\'t a necessity for anyone. Additionally, most people should stay off their phones because it is a hazardous situation in general. For example, people tend to crash into others when they are too attentive to their cellular device. If one is not careful, an accident on the road is waiting to occur and it could be just around the corner. Although plenty of people may say that it is important to check for work or some other related or unrelated topic, the other person should understand that it would be illegal and unsafe to check the phone while driving.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nShould phones be acceptable to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Today, we will basically cover why people should be able to drive and use their cell phones. Nowadays, with all the technology some cars are capable to drive on their own. Tesla would be a company that has started this whole new thing called autopilot.\\n\\nAutopilot is an advanced driver assistance system which has lane centering, adaptive cruise control, self-parking, the ability to automatically change lanes, and the ability to summon the car to and from a garage or parking spot. If you were to have that feature the car basically drives itself with asking you every 30 seconds to 2 minutes to grab the steering wheel and move it side to side just a little. Tesla has also announced sometime in 2020 that the car will be able to detect stop signs, cross-walks, stop lights, etc,. Which means the car is fully capable to drive itself anywhere you put the navigation to take you and you could fall asleep to your destination.\\n\\nIn addition, the Tesla model 3 has been tested and said to be one of the safest cars in the world with many of its safety features in the cars system. So if you're capable of purchasing the car then I think you should be able to use the phone while driving sense the vehicle is driving to begin with. But if you can not purchase the vehicle I think you should be able to use the navigation system on the phone and have it set up to where it's not dangerous to look of the road for a second as if you were checking how fast your going. Most people can not afford that car and they drive older models of cars which don't have all the new technology in their car and all the extra luxury.\\n\\nIn other words, phones should be allowed for some people to use while driving, while others can not. It really can not be unfair because if it was really important for them to use the phone while driving they might think I should work harder in life to be able to do all their things while driving. So people should and should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving.   \",\n",

Either texting or talking on the phone. That message or call can wait until you get where you are going. Teens and adults should turn off their phones before they start the car. This could save your life and the life of others.\\n\\nThe law enforcement should also set good examples by not letting others see them talking and texting while driving. Parents also should set the example of not texting and driving. Some states have passed laws where it is illegal to have a phone in your hand while driving. I believe that all states should pass this law. Or have cars that will not start if it indicates a phone on or in use when trying to crank it up.\\n\\nIf they have a phone use the safe while not driving button. That way messages and calls will not come in and let others know they are driving and will call when its safe.   \",\n",

       " \"Today a fair amount of humans is very much likely use to being on their cellular device daily. As multiple years pass by technology becomes more and more common. Common enough for individuals to believe it's appropriate to be on their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Unfortunately, cell phones have overall become a huge distraction, especially while operating a vehicle. Driving should not be able to use cell phones under no circumstance due to innocent lives being put at risk, setting a bad example for children, and a higher chance of having a high insurance bill.\\n\\nTo begin with, when making the decision of being on your phone while driving not only are you putting yourself at risk your also putting other innocent lives at risk. Putting only yourself in danger is one thing but outing other in danger is another. As little as just glancing at one text you're selfishly putting an innocent individual in danger. Which demonstrates why one peek off the road can cause such a distraction. However, while making these bad decisions children around you are slowly picking up to your actions.\\n\\nSecondly, driving and texting can set a bad example for the children watching. Now and days young ones are very observing, which cause them to catch on to things fast and think it's okay to do certain things. Very often you could be driving with younger individuals. While driving with these individuals your most likely older, meaning you should be a role model to them. Portraying that driving and being on your phone is wrong and shouldn't be done, so if you won't drive and be on your phone then younger ones will pick up on that and also won't.\\n\\nLast but not least, driving and being on your phone has a possibility of increasing your car insurance. Since the hands free law has been strongly enforced so many individuals have been complaining about high insurance knowing they have been pulled over for being on their phone. Of course nobody likes high insurance if you haven't heard it from your mother yet. In fact, high insurance rates can be prevented simply by just waiting to answer that call or text. To help others out there is a driving mode that you can put on your phone to prevent you from being distracted from the rode.\\n\\nAll in all, driving while occupying a vehicle should not be allowed to prevent putting innocent individuals at risk, setting a horrible example for the minors around you, and to prevent high insurance rates. Overall driving and being on a cellular device is a huge distraction in our society as of today. Just one simple glance off the rode can suddenly change your life in a horrific way. Just taking a phone call is dangerous enough, so imagine texting. Take time in your day and remember if that text or call is worth your life before picking up your phone behind the wheel.               \",\n",
       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nCell phones! Almost everyone has a smart phone these days. You could say it's required in life now. They are also a big distraction, phones and driving do not pair together. There is to much going on with phones for you to be focused on the road and a screen at the same time.\\n\\nOne reason is there is alot of teen drivers and most of them can't focus on two things at once. There would be way more distractions and accidents. It would peoples lives in great danger. Most teen already use their phones while driving, there should be stricter laws to prevent this\\n\\nTexting and driving should be a serious crime. It should be as punishable as being intoxicated and driving. It is very unsafe once again. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.\\n\\nA way to prevent this is making cell phone companies come up with a way to lock the phone when a user is moving too fast. It would help prevent car crashes and save lives.90 percent of drivers said they used their smartphones while on the road, according to a survey by the Ny Post.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones and driving should be highly illegal and should not be tolerated at all. Statistics show that phones are a cause of most car crashes these days. Phones may be one of the most important items, they can save lives but also end them. Don't let your phone control you.                  \",\n",
       " \"Phones and driving\\n\\nDrivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones because it can cause so many problems, if they are being distracted they could cause an accident, they could run someone over, and they can also cause big problems. All this can be stopped but many people don't really care enough for that, even if there has been a law passed they still will keep texting and driving.\\n\\nThe people that text and drive are mostly teens, they never seem to put their phones down. Many teens have died from texting while driving, but that will never put an effect to the teens. You can tell a teen to stop texting and driving but they will never listen, they will keep doing it till they end up in an accident. About 1,300,000 are killed by car accidents, most of them are caused by distracted drivers. Many people do get killed by the accident but many are left disabled, meaning they won't be able to walk for years, but they are also left with the memory of them getting ran over. So many people nowadays stay on their phone, a text can wait. If you're are a traffic light, that text can wait till you're at your destination. Yes, there are many impatient people,but they should understand there are many people dying by one simple text, or a simple call.\\n\\nBy being distracted by their phone, they don't pay attention. A teen can look down for a quick second and they could run over a kid. Many people need to realize that texting while driving can cost a lot, it can cost someone's life.\\n\\nEven adults end up killing children. If you can't wait to send a text after you finish driving, then you shouldn't be driving at all. You can seriously end up killing one person over one simple little text that can wait. About 55 million people die a year, about a million of them are from texting and driving. There are many people that end up getting run over, but most of them are because the driver is distracted by their phone. Many people can deny that they wasn't texting and driving but little they know that there is a camera at every traffic light now. Georgia passed a law about using their phone while driving, it caused more police to be out on the roads, protecting and watching who is using their phones.\\n\\nTexting and driving can cause many problem, it's not just accidents or running people over. The ticket they get can be paid off but they will keep using their phone no matter what. Teens are the main ones that use their phones while driving to show off they have a car or to show off they can drive. I personally have a cousin that drives and uses his phone, many times i had to take his phone away to keep him from getting us in an accident. He will never listen till it happens to him. Therefore the law does nothing really, it won't stop people from using their phones. They will keep using their phones till they end up causing an accident or actually killing someone.\\n\\nUsing the phone while driving is very dangerous, but no one will listen till it happens to them. Many people die a day, if we don't hear it on the news, it happens no matter what. If ever accident was on the news you will see how many people keep driving and texting, they will see how many people have died from that. We should have something to keep them from texting and driving, even calling someone can cause an accident. The people who are on their phones while driving can cause traffic or an accident.   \",\n",
       " \"Driving and technology today\\n\\nOver the years technology has advanced to where you don't even need to be at home to make a phone call now you can make one anywhere. Being able to make a phone call or text should have an appropriate time and place. By that I mean that you shouldn't be able to use your phone while driving. That is not he appropriate place nor time to use your phone. There is are many reasons why using your phone while driving is not a good idea.\\n\\nThere is no reason why you should be looking anywhere else except the road while driving its a driving hazard and it can have many bad conquicences. Your eyes should be on the road the entire time you are driving like they teach you in driving school. Even if you look away for a second anything can happen when you are not paying attention. Today most car crashes or accidents on the road are caused by technology.\\n\\nMany states have made laws about how you are not allowed to use your phone while driving this is in place because it helps prevent bad things from happening on the road. Appropriate places to use your phone would be at a red light or in a parking lot before you start to drive or before you leave the place that you are at. Knowing when you should use your phone at the appropriate time can make the roads much more safer to drive on.\\n\\nIn conclusion you should make the roads a safer place by not using your phone while driving it can have a various amount of coniquinces. Being safer on the roads and not risking someones life is way more important than a text that can be sent after you are done driving. There is not a text or a phone call that is worth more than someones life.   \",\n",
       " 'Everyday people die in the car accidents because they use cell phone while driving. According to the research I look up cell phone are leading people to have a car accident studies show that a cell phone put driver in to car accident people still use cell phone because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving Edgar Snyder. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away Argus leader.\\n\\nA 17 year old girl was driving in Jacksonville Florida. She said that she just Gilbert3 glanced down at her cell phone\" when she struck a 44 year old man. He was working on side of the road with his tree trimming crew when he was struck by the distracted driver. Although cell phone have not been around for a long time they have become a key part of people life.   ',\n",
       " \"Should drivers be able to use cell phones while in any capacity while operating a vehicle ? Drivers shouldnt be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because of a list of reasons, they could easily be distracted and cause a wreck which could lead to serious injuries or even in worst cases cause death. Drivers now have the technology to have bluetooth devices which should be put to use.\\n\\nDrivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones while driving a vehicle because it could cause them to be distracted and they could cause serious injuries to other people who they are sharing the road with , whether there is a bicyclist , pedestrians walking, or most of the time other drivers . This is just one of many reasons why drivers shouldnt be able to use their cellphones while operating vehicles. Safety is a huge factor in this discussion because the road should be a person's primary focus while operating a vehicle in order to keep everyone in the vehicle safe.\\n\\nSecondly, drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones because they would risk getting pulled over by the police which could lead to tickets and having to pay money, for some depending on their background could be locked up. All of these possible outcomes could be avoided if drivers were not allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle .\\n\\nWays to prevent drivers from having to use their cellphones would be to make vehicle bluetooth devices affordable for everyone who owns a vehicle. That way they wouldn't have to physically touch or be on their phone while operating a vehicle. Instead they could just get everything set up before they start driving and talk into their phone, instead of picking it up to answer a call or text, which could cause them to be distracted while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion drivers should not be able to use cellphones because they would be putting not only themselves in danger but others who they share the road with. They should also not be able to use cellphones to avoid getting pulled over to avoid the consequences that may come with that. Ways to prevent drivers from using their cellphones while driving would be for companies who create bluetooth devices to make them affordable for everyone who owns a vehicle to minimize incidents while driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nDriving is very convenient in this time and age. Not only is driving convenient but also a prominent way of transportation everywhere. Driving has many good effects on society today but can be dangerous and in many ways even fatal. Something that has a big effect on driving is the smartphone people keep with them every day all day. Texting and driving has been consistently taking the lives of drivers behind the wheel. Texting and driving should not be allowed in this time in age nor in the future.\\n\\nTexting and driving comes with the ultimate risk being a life. Many people, teens especially, are losing their lives in car accidents. The cause of these car accidents could be avoided if these people were not texting while driving. The text states \"...the number of auto fatalities has remained stable, at about 40,000 deaths a year. The US Department of Transportation estimates that 6,000 of those are the result of distracted driving.\" The textual evidence shows that phones and driving can be a large factor in deaths while driving. The most important part is how the phones are killing off these people.\\n\\nWhen texting and driving is occurring at the same time it forces the driver to multitask. Some evidence states \"Driving and cell phone conversations both require a great deal of thought. When doing them at the same time, your brain is unable to do either well.\" Multitasking is already hard on people and then their attention span makes texting and driving an even worse idea. In the text it states \"According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the average attention span of a human being has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013\". This evidence shows that humans already have a short attention span, so imagine a younger person with a weaker mind texting and driving.\\n\\nThe texting while driving epidemic has its biggest effect on the younger people. The youths are more likely to have and be using a smartphone while driving than elders. This is supported by the claim \"Younger age groups are also much more likely to use social media sites like Facebook than older ones.\" This shows that youths are more likely to be affected by the epidemic of texting and driving. In the text it also states \"In every country surveyed, those under 35 are more likely to own smartphones, to use the internet and to use social media than those ages 50 and older.\" Smart phones have more of an influence on younger people as seen in the text.\\n\\nTexting and driving is something that would not benefit anyone if it were allowed. Not only should texting and driving not be allowed but it should be outlawed. This epidemic has already claimed the lives of so many people. People all over the world are losing their lives and sustaining permanent injuries from texting and driving. This needs to be stopped permanently by being outlawed and kept out of mind.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHanes, Stephanie. \"Texting While Driving Is as Dangerous as Drunk Driving.\" Distracted Driving, edited by Stefan Kiesbye, Greenhaven Press, 2012.

       " 'Cell phones has become very popular over the past few years. Almost everybody who is old enough to drive have a cell phone. Cell phones are good to have and you have to know when to use it and how to use it. For instance using your phone while operating a vehicle is not ok.\\n\\nReason one drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because it causes accidents. When you\\'re using your phone while whether you are on Facebook or texting you are now giving your cell phone attention instead of paying attention to how you are driving. General cell phone statistics states that \"cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". They also states that \"1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving\".\\n\\nReason two is it costs you money in the long run. Everybody knows it\\'s against the law to use a cell phone while operating a motored vehicle. You can easily get a ticket and have to go to court. Or if you get to many tickets you can have you license suspended. It can also cost you your life or someone else life.\\n\\nTherefore no, I don\\'t think it\\'s ok to use your cell phone while operating a vehicle. Even though cell phones are addictive there is an appropriate time to use them. That appropriate time is when you are home, not while operating a vehicle.      ',\n",
       " \"Safety Over Status\\n\\nDo you use a cellphone while on the road? Then your moments away from possibly causing a tragedy. When driving in a vehicle a phone isn't needed. A cell phone is nothing but and distraction on the road, that could lead to catastrophes by mer seconds of a person looking down to check a notification, post, or whatever.\\n\\nI believe we shouldn't have anyone cellular device in or visual area unless you are in a predicament where you need it to safe either your life or another person's. Phones should be used for that purpose and that purpose only there's no need to be updated with social media 24/7 when you could simple wait when your home. Would you rather check a tweet and run someone over on accident towards your destination or drive safely towards your destination without hitting a thing. All it takes is for everyone to ignore the rings and buzzes of their phone.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nCell phone use while driving is one of those hot button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cellphone. When it goes off while they are driving weather it is a message , social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them as they feel as if they have to look now. Using cellphones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.\\n\\nOne reason why cellphones while driving should be banned is let's start with texts social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rear view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.\\n\\nAs for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, pull over to the side of the road, take the call and then retire driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.\\n\\nEven hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.\\n\\nWhatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.               \",\n",
       " 'Not Using Phones in a Vehicle\\n\\nCrashes, getting pulled over, and not paying attention to the road- nobody likes those things, well, most of it comes from cellphones. Operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.\\n\\nCrashes are one of the main causes of death today. The Zebra states that \"Nearly nine people die and 1,000 are injured from car accidents daily where one is distracted by a phone.\" This implies that most accidents are caused by someone operating cellphones on the road, which shows you how much people stay on their phone in the car and why it is not good for you. In summary of this paragraph driving while on the phone is not good for you.\\n\\nGetting pulled over by the cops because of being on your phone while driving happens a lot. While people are in real situations you are getting pulled over by a cop because of a cellphone. The Seattle Times said that \"Individuals are getting fined $136 for a first ticket and\\n\\n$234 for additional tickets.\" This shows that if you get pulled over for being on your phone you will be fined for it. In other words it is another example why not to be on your phone while driving.\\n\\nNot paying attention to the road is mainly caused by a cellphone. Most people when on phones in a car are not paying attention to the road which means they could hit someone or something, hit another car, or run off the road. On Wikipedia they say that \"Drivers are distracted, decreasing the drivers awareness on the road.\" This confirms that driving and using a phone causes people to not pay attention to the road. Therefore, operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.\\n\\nIn conclusion to this essay, I explain how driving and operating a phone is not good for you. You could also help by turning off or silencing your phone when you enter the car and drive safely. It could lead to less crashes, less tickets, and a safer drive.   ',\n",
       " \"Smartphones have been something cool, useful, and amazing to have but what's dangerous about this technology is about using them while driving. There are and still today many accidents created on the road, highways, or even in big cities. People who have been texting while driving has a high risks of getting in a huge accident and can have you pay a fine of 20 upto 400 dollars. In georgia is $150 if a cop catches you with your phone while driving. There are some states that texting and driving is illegal.\\n\\nYou already seen that the cells phones today are more advanced smart, fancy, and quick with better technology than before. From black to metallic white with glass back wireless charging where anybody can afford them and they're going to be more use around here even driving because everyone wants to try the new phone which is a big distraction. Many people loses focus on the road and that's when accidents happen even though many people who gets their license, they still dont respect the rules of driving and especially texting and driving.\\n\\nMany opponents would say cellphones are needed for just in case of emergencies but what if your in a accident and you are stuck and the phone is kinda far you cant grab it why because you stuck and cellphones aren't reliable though. So if people don't give up cell phones then the number of fatalities will increase. Its people's responsibilities to not include their lives and others.   \",\n",
       " 'In 2019 alone there was a reported factor of 8.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes due to distracted drivers. In 2018 the reported number of deaths due to cell phone and electronic device use was 4,637 people. Distracted driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Sending a text message,using your GPS or talking on a cell phone is considered as distracted driving .For this very reason sum states have looked into coming up with a way to prevent drivers from being distracted.\\n\\nAccording to the new law that was passed on May 2,2018 anyone driving in the state of Georgia is to abide by the \"No Hands Law\". With this law being in effect,this means any and every person behind the wheel shall not have a phone in their hand or have it touching any part of their body while behind the wheel. If you are caught with the phone in your hand the penalties wi be for your First offense will be a $50.00 fine , Second offense will be a $100.00 fine, and the Third offense is at\\n\\n$150.00 fine. Points will also be added to your drivers record. Once you accumulate too many points within a certain period of time your license will be suspended or revoked. In addition your insurance premium will increase.\\n\\nIn essence my belief is that drivers should not be able to have a electronic device in their possession,while behind the wheel. The reason I believe this is because there are entirely too many deaths because of distracted drivers. Taking your attention from the role may harm or kill a person. Distracted driving may also cause devastation for family. It may also put a financial burden on families which can affect them mentally as well as physically.\\n\\nCould you imagine what would happen if people just put down their phones? Can you imagine how many people\\'s lives will be saved? All it takes is for you to put our phone down while driving .You are not only jeopardizing your life but the lives of others citizens as well. The very few seconds that are taken for reading a text message can be the very seconds that can take or harm a life.\\n\\nThere is no other feeling worse than taking the life of someone else\\'s family member. Having to watch that family grieve and bury their loved ones can hunt you for the rest of your life. As responsible drivers remember we are not only driving for ourselves but others as well. Let\\'s all step up and pledge today to participate in the no hands law. This will automatically lead to less accidents and safer driving.                 ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nNow in days, many people know how to use a cell phone and even own a cell phone. Many people tend to use their cell phone while driving and many states have placed in a law that has prohibited cell phone use while operating a vehicle. Yet regardless of the law, many still question if this law should be in place.\\n\\nI feel that people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while behind the wheel because it's dangerous overall. Studies have shown that more than 3,000 people have been killed and 416,000 have been seriously injured because of a distracted driver. It has also been proven that cell phones distract a person by 37% while driving, meaning that you aren't as focused on driving and you are more likely to be holding a device with one hand. This limits the maneuverability of your other hand while driving. In 2006 a study was released by the university of utah which said the drivers that use their phones while driving are as dangerous as drunk drivers.\\n\\nMany states have made a law that bans phone use while driving due to the increased danger. For example, in georgia it's prohibited to even hold a phone while driving. If caught, you could be given a primary offense. But then again, it depends by state and in fact, your insurance can go up if you get a ticket. It ranges from 4 to 30%. Many states like Florida, Tennessee, and 19 other states have a similar law in place. Currently, cell phone tickets don't go down as a dmv point but that might change on January 2021.\\n\\nThere are many stories of horrible accident that happened while using a cell phone and driving. For example, in minnesota a 17 year-old killed a 10 year-old and her father when she ran a red light because she was texting. She is expected to serve 4 years of probation and over 200 hours of community hours. In kansas state university, a 19 year-old died because of a one letter text. And now her older sister educates teenagers on the risks and dangers of texting and driving. In reality, these drivers aren't just putting their life in danger but they are putting others in danger too.\\n\\nWith all this information, I stick with my decision that people shouldn't be able to use their phone and drive. It's just a very dangerous decision. And even though there's a law in place to help improve this problem, people still tend to ignore it. They're putting everyone, including themselves, in danger. Innocent people shouldn't be in danger and it's not just grown ups but little children. Nobody should be in danger over something that can wait. I feel like people should just follow the law because it's only for their safety and everyone else'      \",\n",
       " \"Drivers Should Not Be Able To Use Cell Phone In Any Capacity While Operating A Vehicle\\n\\nHow many of you have been in a car accident? Now how many of you have used your phone while behind the wheel of a car? Imagine looking down checking a text message for a second then you look up and BOOM. Research shows cell phones are the leading cause of motor vehicle accidents in teens. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use their phone while driving.\\n\\nSome argue due to their occupation they have to always be available to answer the phone. However, work can be stressful and while driving possibly dangerous. Resulting from an upsetting conversation you may be distracted and may lower your driving ability. Checking one text message could end your life in an instant. Mind you teens are still in the mist of officially learning how to drive properly. Cell phones are an obvious distraction and will prohibit you from doing so.\\n\\nFor example, October 18, 2013 was the day a 17 year old teenager named Sydnee Williams lost her life. She was driving when she made the decision to pick up her phone and text while driving. Williams was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the car after crashing. Two days later sadly succumb Sydnee to her injuries and passed away. Though she was the only person in the car her life was not the only one that ended that day.\\n\\nTexting while driving is completely illegal in 47 states as well as Washington D.C. Fines can range from $20 to up to $500 depending on the state. Other states this action can result in criminal misdemeanor charges. If the offense has resulted in a bodily injury to another person prison or jail time may be imposed. Not only are you putting your life in danger but possibly others. Now do u think jail time is worth replying to a text that could have waited.\\n\\nIn conclusion we don't want to lose another life because cell phones. They are a distraction and a safety risk. Even if you don't lose your life you could end somebody else's. Overall things it's just down right illegal. In my opinion cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle in any capacity.      \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nAlmost every teen and adult citizen has a phone and a car, and most of them use their phone while operating an automobile. They get distracted, don't know when a light is turning green and hold up traffic, and mostly accidents. They drift out of their lane into another drivers lane and wont look up until the other car has honked or they feel the car not going in the right direction, or will possibly hit someone. Drivers should not drive and use a cellular device because their holding up traffic and putting people's lives in danger from not paying attention to the road. It's safer to get a phone mount for your car so that you won't have to hold the device and keep your hands on the wheel. If your driving on a road, I advice if you only use your phone for navigation and music and stay off social media until you are parked or at your destination. Scrolling through the internet or social media is not worth losing your life or anyone else's life, or damaging you or someone else's vehicle. Therefore, 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their device behind the wheel of an automobile. I think it's best drivers keep their phone out of their hands while driving because its so many people on the road today and your risking you and all their lives because you wanted to be on your phone and not keep your eyes on the road. Just 5 seconds your eyes can be off the road and you'll hit someone. It doesn't take long for your car to take control of what way it goes when you aren't paying attention. There are countless other lives on the road who have futures to look forward to. It´ll be the right thing to teach the next generation to not have a device in their hand while driving especially with these new cars with technology in them for hands-free driving, its all compatible for your phone but you dont technically use your phone because its all in the car by the touch of a button on the stearing wheel or on the cabin. Most children and teens look up to what other people are doing and think its okay that they do it unless they were tought better not to. Its important to watch what your doing and pay attention to your surroundings, to your children or upcoming drivers thatll be on the road and teach them the right things to do on the road and what to do when something goes wrong.\\n\\n2                                                   \",\n",

They need more focus on the road than the phone cause you can do it later.\\n\\nThere are about 1.6 millions crashes each year. There is like about 1 out of 4 crashes that are because of phone or texting. Some of them happen because some people don't like to use their phone on speaker or to the car's bluetooth. Texting and driving can cause 6x more than drunk driving. The attention that takes off your phone is worse than being drunk and drive.\\n\\nThe best thing is not to phone and drive. It is not the best thing because you should care about other people's life and themselves. Someone can get hurt badly when it's your fault for using your phone while driving.

As much as this problem continues to rise the change never occurs. About 1.6 million crashes happen each year. As we continue on to invent the new , we should also pay attention to the problem they surface. As many crashes we have each year no person should be able use their phones while driving.\\n\\nNot all accidents that occur from texting and driving end badly but they definitely should be a sign to stop driving that way. Every day , 11 teenagers die from texting and driving accidents. By texting and driving you increase the risk of an accident by 23 times. As years go by the percentage only increases. As this problem keeps arising the government has taken it in their hands to make sure this stops. When texting and driving a teenager or person gets distracted and even if it's 30 seconds you are still putting your life in jeopardy. A car accident can occur within 15 seconds of someone texting and driving.\\n\\nMany teenagers who text and drive don't see it to their 20th birthday. To prevent this we have to take action and enforce the no texting while driving rule extremely. Driving schools should also go a step further and make categories mainly on texting while driving. As the adult should stay off their phone as well they should also set an example for teenagers. Though our phones are distractions we can easily make them something we don't have to worry about. Most phones this generation contain driving modes , do not disturb , and also silent modes. By using those modes it will distract us from our phone and keep us focused on the road.\\n\\nAs the world continues to change the way we drive does too. That begins with paying attention to the road. As a generation we have set the bar of what things should be by not texting and driving to decrease the number of innocent lives and our own. It is up to us and also the law to make this problem something we don't have to face. We could save many lives by keeping our eyes on the road without texting and driving.         \",\n",

We take these situations lightly until something really happens and then we wish we could take it all back.\\n\\nTexting and driving can be a serious hazard; for example, a Georgia teen, Cristina PavonBaker, got 15 years for killing her best friend. She was driving 105 mph, racing another student then she started to use snapchat and crashed into a tree.

You can be killed or can kill someone if you are distracted driving. We are always distracted by our phones so when we are driving, we are tempted to get on it and do stuff. When we do, we have consequences to our actions and sometimes we must pay for what we do. We need to take responsibility and own up for our actions. We need to stop taking things like this lightly.

Cell phones have turn into the standard part of daily life and some people attempt to move their cell phones down, even while taking. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cell phones every day, while riding behind the bike within daytime times. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the major cause of vehicle accidents over the last two decades. Using the cellphone while driving increases the driver's probability of getting the accident. Drivers are troubled, lessening the driver's consciousness on tour, leading to more automobile accidents.\\n\\nMobile phone overuse can be especially dangerous in certain situations such as texting and driving or talking on the phone while driving. Over 8 people are killed and 1,161 are injured daily because of distracted driving.

With all the many Apple and Android products out right now and all the new technology it makes us more engaged into our phones, such as quick reply. Although features like that makes it easier for people to communicate in a time consuming way, it is very obvious that it takes the attention of the driver which could lead them to vehicle involved accidents.\\n\\nIt is never a good idea to be on your phone and drive. It causes major distractions for drivers. According to \"The National Safety Council\" cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. (Edgar Snyder, 2019). Given this information and other cited sources, it is safe to say that a single text could lead to a tragic accident in a matter of seconds. Drivers should be alert and always pay attention to the road.\\n\\nNot only is being on your phone while driving dangerous, it is also illegal. The NCSL (National Conference of State Legislators) stated on their website, that texting while driving is banned in forty-eight out of fifty states. Also including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The NCSL website includes state specific regulations regarding texting while driving, informing the public about the different risks and consequences of drivers who are caught texting while driving. The consequences listed on the website include jail time, fines, or loss of license.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that texting while driving is a distraction and raises high risks to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians on a daily basis.

Humans should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nUsing a cell phone while operating a vehicle can cause a person to be distracted and their focus to be shifted from the road to their device. If a vehicle is driving at sixty miles per hour, a second of distracting phone usage can cause the driver to miss hundreds of feet ahead of them leaving them vulnerable to any possible accidents in front of them. This is a danger to not only the driver but to any other drivers on the road and can lead to unnecessary injuries. Banning any phone usage while driving will greatly decrease the amount of injuries and deaths due to automobile accidents.\\n\\nThere are already many efforts from both phone and car manufacturers to try and help the problem of phone usage while driving. Phone companies have started to implement different apps that can turn phone notifications off while a person is driving. Such as Apple with Do Not Disturb While Driving that tracks when you are driving and blocks all calls, texts and other notifications. Car manufacturers also do not let drivers pair their phone to the car bluetooth while the car is driving.

I feel like the only reasons you should be able to use your phone in the car/ operating machinery is when your using the GPS or trying to play music and at that point you should be using voice control.\\n\\nLike I said at the beginning of the introduction a lot of us in this world cannot multitask. We don't have the attention span to pay attention to the road and be on our phones. As soon as we see that text from our mom, significant other, or crush whoever it may be we immediately look at the phone and try to text them back. Me knowing me I can't try to do anything phone related because once I'm on my phone I check all my emails, social media, and everything interesting there. Trying to operate machinery while while being on your phone is extremely life threatening especially using power tools and or heavy equipment. When I say heavy machinery I mean cars too. Texting and driving or even being on the phone are driving are one of the biggest factors in the death rate of the united states at a whopping 41.75% a year.\\n\\nVoice control...

Technology has come a long way for example, handwriting, post riders by horse and delivery systems, telephone operator switchboards, house phones, emails coming from a computer and eventually we got to cell phones, smart TVs, and smart cars. With standard technology not only did it bring a lot of different ways of communicating with others it has brought many dangers to people and the community but the difference from using devices then is that it is now dangerous. In this essay I will cover a few reasons, statistics and solutions.\\n\\nIn this day in time we have started to depend on our cellular devices more than ever.\\n\\nNowadays some people do not like to talk on the cell phone but instead send text messages or self-gratification such as pictures and videos while driving. Texting and driving have been a leading cause of car crashes, bodily injury, and even deaths. The reasons why people should not use cell phones while driving is because you are not in control or fully focused and you are more likely to get in a car crash and most likely be at fault for it. It is one of the leading causes of deaths on the highway, and it is also illegal to use phones while driving now.\\n\\nStatistics show \"Texting while driving is more of a problem now than ever, as 69 percent of\\n\\nU.S. drivers between the ages of 18 to 64 have admitted to using their cell phones while driving.\\n\\nStatistics show \"Texting while driving is more of a problem now than ever, as 69 percent of\\n\\nU.S. drivers between the ages of 18 to 64 have admitted to using their cell phones while driving, during the previous month.\" Since texting increases the likelihood of accidents by 23 times. It is a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. It only takes three seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or any other device. \"While 26 percent of all motor vehicle crashes are related to the use of cell phones. Each day the average of 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving.\"\\n\\nThe solutions to preventing the mishaps from texting and driving. For example, do not use the phone for talking, texting, and social media while driving. You can turn your phone on silent or just turn it off so you can avoid getting any notifications or distractions. If you are with a passenger or more, if it is needed let them send the message for you or check the notifications instead of putting everybody and yourself at risk for something that can wait. If it is urgent you can even pull over and check it if there is no risk of dangers. If you are a licensed driver you are expected to obey the laws on cell phone usage and operating a vehicle.\\n\\nThese are the reasons why cell phone usage should be prohibited while driving. It is simply not worth it, you can also be arrested and fined. Also, you can cause hurt and heart ache between family and friends and it can weigh heavily on your conscience financially and mentally. This is one area my parents constantly talk about when teaching me how to drive. I can agree it is a distraction to many teenagers but one story my mom shared with me about a young girl getting killed while texting will always be in my subconscious.

As well as putting yourself in danger, you risk the lives of other innocent people driving on roads you've made dangerous for them.\\n\\nThe endangerment of the loss of focus from the road jeopardizes not only the people in vehicles but also pedestrians walking the street.

In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction related accidents, while 421,000 people were injured in the same accidents in America. Texting or talking to someone while driving is illegal for a reason. A text or call is not worth others wellbeing. Phones and other devices should not be used while operating any type of vehicle on the road because it will increase your chances of hurting someone or yourself.\\n\\nTo start, operating a vehicle while using a cellular device can increase your risk of crashing. While people focus on their phones, it's impossible to focus 100% of attention on the road. Due to that, more accidents happen. Insurance will increase if they find out someone has been driving while distracted on their phone. A result of a car crash usually results in someone being hurt. Sometimes people even die from these same car accidents!\\n\\nOf course, killing someone on accident isn't ideal. Is someone's life or family really worth risking over a text or call? It doesn't take much for a car crash to happen, so if someone is distracted by a phone, it is much more likely to happen. In 2014, cell phone usage caused 24% of car accidents. It may not sound like much, but that is a large percentage of people that were involved in a car accident in 2014. There were 6,064,000 accidents in 2014, and 24% of that is 1,455,360. Using the same source, around 35,000 of those 1,455,360 were deaths. That is not the only thing you are risking, however.\\n\\nIn addition to putting others lives in danger, you are putting yourself at a great risk as well. Those same statistics are not exclusive to the others you affect. It affects you as well. A simple text or phone call could throw you off and quickly end your life. It's just as simple as glancing at a text message. Anything around you at that moment, can harm and potentially kill you.\\n\\nTo conclude, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is illegal for a reason. When someone chooses to text and drive (or call and drive), they are putting a families life at risk, as well as themselves. Even if no one is hurt or dies, there is still the car accident they have to deal with. Cost and insurance will be a nightmare for them.

       " \"Should Cell Phones Be Used While Driving a Vehicle?\\n\\nToday, the Majority of humans own and operate Cell Phones on a daily basis.\\n\\nFor example, using your phone while operating a vehicle. Drivers should not be able to use Cell Phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I personally think it would free up car accidents as in not so many accidents that deal with using your Cell Phone. Cell Phones use cause over 1 in 4 accidents. Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free Cell Phones. Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free cellphones. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 27% of car crashes in 2013 were caused by cell phone use. Cell Phones use and hands free illegal in schools or highway work zones, However, California, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Jersey, and Georgia etc. Prohibit all drivers from using hand held cell phones while driving. Cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. That's why I say no Cell Phones should be used while operating a motor vehicle at any time. It would prevent less car accidents from cell phone use.\\n\\nIn 2015, 42% of high school students reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive. Parents should avoid calling their teens when he or she is driving. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving. A federal transportation funding law passed in July 2012, known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. This is the kind of concrete information that can arm the people trying to combat distracted driving and it's a heated battle. The hand held law is necessary and important, but if it is not combined with warnings about the dangers of hand free calls, then it may inadvertently promote an almost equally distracting and dangerous behavior. So if you think tempted to make or take a hands free call, think again. It could kill.   \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers be allowed or not allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No drivers should be able to have a phone while driving, there are many reasons to why drivers shouldn't have cell phones while driving. Drivers tend to be distracted while on there cell phones and it can lead car crashes, death, serious injuries to you or the others person you injured while you were on your cellphone. Causing an accident while driving with distractions you will be charged with manslaughter and will serve jail time for eight years under federal law.\\n\\nPhones shouldn't be allowed not only because of car accidents but it can also cause insurances to rise and making many people spend more money for insurance because people are distracted with there cellphones and not paying attention to the road. Car crashes can cause many accidents not just one but multiple all at one time, someone can loose there life in a second without blinking all because you got distracted and wanted to get one last text message, that one last text message could be you ending someone's life even your own.   \",\n",
       " 'Should cellphones be allowed when driving?\\n\\nAs the times have progressed, cell phones have become extremely prevalent in the daily lives of many. To add on, cell phone usage has also increased substantially. From playing music in the shower to using phones to keeping daily tasks organized, cell phones have grown to become an essential part of human life. It is hard to deny that cell phones have become so infused in our daily lives. This has caused many to pose the question as to whether or not cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle. While a total ban of cellphone usage may seem unrealistic,using a phone at any capacity not only poses a threat to the driver or the passengers but also other drivers on the road. Due to the risks posed by using a cell phone when driving, cell phones use should be banned when operating a vehicle.\\n\\nTo begin, cell phone usage when driving can cause a major distraction to the driver who is operating the vehicle. All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first \"place\" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. This is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person\\'s effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons? Some may argue that cell phone usage should be allowed by drivers when operating a vehicle with certain restrictions. However, once drivers feel like they have the go ahead to use their cellphone in any capacity, some may still try to go above and beyond to break the rules. Using a phone at any capacity poses a huge risk for all people on the road.\\n\\nMoreover,using a cellular device in a car is not necessary. According to a study conducted in 1995, only 13 percent of the United States population owned cell phones. This statistic goes to prove that before cell phones became widely popular; people were able to operate vehicles without it. Some may argue that phones provide GPS services that assist in getting drivers to their destination,which by all accounts is true. However, phones aren\\'t the only devices that provide GPS services. There are actual GPS devices that prove way more accurate than cell phone applications. Also, these GPS devices pose way less of a threat when it comes to distracting drivers as they are strictly meant for giving directions instead of having multiple purposes. If drivers have some kind of emergency such as a death or injury in the family, drivers can pull into a parking lot or pull over on the side of the road in order to communicate with whomever they need to communicate with. There is no acceptable reason as to why one should be using their cell phone while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nLastly, when operating a vehicle in general you have the ability to kill someone due to your attention being impaired. When adding a person using a phone while operating a vehicle, the risk of killing someone increases. When operating a cellphone while driving, the drivers eyes can be taken off the road from anywhere to a few seconds to a few minutes. Driving is not a perfect situation. People constantly break,stop, speed up, and slow down. Taking eyes off the road for even one second can cause a serious accident on the road. The president of the National Safety Council reported that talking on a cellphone while driving makes one four times more likely to get in a crash. Talking on a phone is such a risk that the National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cell phone usage when driving due to the fact that 100 million people use their phones in a day. Using a cell phone when driving can not only jeopardize the drivers life but also passengers in their car and others on the road. Driving while using a device has the ability to cause a premature death when the drivers are distracted.\\n\\nCell phone usage when operating a vehicle at any capacity is extremely dangerous. This kind of activity poses a threat to not only drivers themselves but passengers and also other users of the road. Cell phone usage when driving can cause drivers to be distracted which in turn if not careful can cause a car crash that leads to serious injuries or death. Furthermore, cell phone usage in a car is not essential and drivers do not need it in order to drive. There is no reasonable explanation as to why cell phones should be used when driving. Laws need to be enacted in order to ban this unacceptable behavior and protect road users.\\n\\nWorks Cited 18 June 2020 · Richard Berry, et al. \"Why You Really Shouldn\\'t Use Your Mobile Phone While Driving.\" CarsGuide, www. carsguide. com. au/car-advice/why-you-really-shouldnt-use-your-mobile-phone-while\\n\\n-driving-33062.\\n\\n\"Should Cell Phone Use Be Banned While Driving?\" Safety & OSHA News, 16 July 2013, www. safetynewsalert. com/should-cell-phone-use-be-banned-while-driving/.\\n\\n\"Should Cell Phone Use by Drivers Be Illegal?\" Product Reviews and Ratings - Consumer Reports, www. consumerreports. org/cro/news/2009/07/should-cell-phone-use-by-drivers-be-illegal/i ndex. htm.\\n\\nStaff, Live Science. \"Should Cell Phones Be Banned While Driving?\" LiveScience, Purch, 12 Jan. 2009, www. livescience. com/3220-cell-phones-banned-driving. html.

       " \"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.\\n\\nThe first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.\\n\\nThe second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.\\n\\nThe last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.\\n\\nThere are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.   \",\n",
       " \"Should people be able to drive a vehicle and use a cell phone yes or no ?\\n\\nToday in Atlanta a lot of car accidents happen due to people being on their phones instead of driving. So therefore I say no people should not be able to use their phones while operating an vehicle. One little text is not worth your life or someone else's life !\\n\\nI think that an law should be passed so that people won't use they phone and if caught using their phones they get a ticket. Of course people don't want to have to pay a fine so they would obey the law. Making this law would keep a lot of car accidents from happening here in atlanta. When on the expressway down here all you see is people on their phone making videos and then boom they hit another car all because they wasn't paying attention to the road.\\n\\nAnother reason I say that you should've be able to use cell phones and drive is because you need both hands to keep control over the wheel. Turning with one hand is hard to do. I actually witness someone have a phone in one and driving with the other one swerve off the road because she couldn't properly control the wheel with one hand. Which had me thinking is being on a phone while driving really worth your life or someone else or even just having to pay extra money to get your car or someone's else fixed all because of a mistake that could've been prevented !\\n\\nWith that being stated please help us get a law to keep people off their phones ! I wouldn't want anything to happen to no one family or mines all because of someone wanting to send a text or make a nice video driving ! It is not worth going to jail for killing or hurting someone or being sued ! Please keep in mind when driving your not just driving for your self your driving for everyone .When you make a wrong it effects everyone. If you swerve other cars would start to swerve because there trying not to get hit. So just wait to send the text or simply call them through the car Bluetooth!              \",\n",
       " \"On May 21, 2016, Christina Mays had been told by her doctor, that she would be expecting her first child. Excited and anxious she decided to text her husband the good news. David Mays was delighted about the news and responded with a sweet message. It is not clear whether Christina saw that sweet message before her car slammed into the back of a truck while merging onto the highway. From the lack of response, David became worried. He attempted to call Christina and left several messages requesting to hear her beautiful voice. But to no avail he could not reach her. David knew something horrible had happened. Christina, a beautiful twenty-year-old was dead. Police ultimately deemed texting the cause of her fatal car crash.\\n\\nAlthough the police found evidence that texting and driving caused her untimely death; the likelihood of a car crash increases drastically with the occurrence of distracted driving.\\n\\nDistracted driving occurs anytime a driver takes their eyes off the road, hands off the wheel or sometimes just simply being a teen carrying too many passengers.\\n\\nDistracted driving is a huge problem, although it is not due to cell phones alone, they are a huge contributor. Taking your eyes off the road, even for a second, can be risky. Because operating a cellphone takes the drivers attention off the road, long enough for them to veer into other lanes of on-coming traffic. Because of this, it only takes a split second for this type of distracted driving to become a fatality. For this reason, it is necessary for drivers to focus on driving only and leave their cellphones in their pockets.\\n\\nSecondly, text messaging requires you to visually and manually use sometimes both of your hands; it is by far the most frightening distraction used by not just teens, but adults as well. Most vehicles are considered a weapon. Consequently, they can cause extreme damages during a crash. This is why it is never safe to take your hands off the wheel, even to answer a call. As a result of this, some states have chosen to pass laws prohibiting motorist form using their cellular devices while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nLastly, most of us realize that social media rules the land. In this day in age, if it's not recorded it didn't happen. Seeing that teen drivers lack experience while driving. Consequently, means that they require more focus than experienced drivers. Therefore, carrying too many passengers while trying to operate a cellphone is hazardous to all parties involved, including innocent bystanders. Studies have shown that too many passengers can be a huge distraction, especially while using a cell phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and any type of distracted driving seems to be a social issue and will possibly take individuals awhile to change or completely stop. Hopefully people will understand sooner than later, that multitasking while driving is dangerous for all.      \",\n",
       " 'Title\\n\\nDrivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving, for the reason that the use of a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle is exceedingly hazardous for the driver, as well as others who are traveling along the same road. The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\"). Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high and can pose serious safety risks. You can be charged with murder for texting and driving. Texting is the most alarming distraction sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. Using a cellphone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on\\n\\nU.S. roads. In 2017 alone 3,166 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes including distracted drivers. Texting and driving is against the law (\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving\").\\n\\nIn an effort to fight these problems, more than 30 states now have a law when it comes to texting and driving(\"The Risks of Texting While Driving\"). The penalties for texting while driving could include hefty fines, license suspension, a rise in auto insurance rates, and prison time. The consequences you\\'ll face for texting and driving are similar to those you\\'d get for another of the most serious driving offenses. (DUI) sometimes drivers who keep on texting do not see any people or animals crossing the street so there is a tendency to hit somebody crossing the road. Texting while driving is bad because it can bring fatal damages towards life. It may ruin the lives of others or worse might cause your life to end. Texting is a huge distraction to all drivers. Numerous drivers do not take this life threatening habit seriously and try to argue that these are an exception to these rules.\\n\\nTexting may be useful, but the use of it can also be very bad. You can not keep both hands on the wheel so accidents may occur. It may put you at greater risk because you fail to see important road signs and signals. Sometimes a stressful text can provoke anger, which might affect your driving behavior. Texting while driving is a horrible idea because you need to look at the phone as you type and read incoming text messages. The vehicle might run over hole or wrong rails which might lead to car accidents. Texting while driving is dangerous and does kill, and has many times. Using a cell phone particularly texting while driving requires the driver to turn his mental attention to the device manipulate it with his hand to look at it.\\n\\nTexting and driving should be banned because it is a hazard, and is an alert that needs to be reduced. The first reason for texting or using a cell phone while driving is very hazardous to yourself and the people surrounding you. Texting and driving is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, emails or making similar use of the web on a mobile device while operating a motor vehicle. Texting while driving is considered extremely dangerous by many people, including authorities and in some places have either been outlawed or restricted. No one should text and drive. Be an example for others and if you need to text or talk on the phone, pull over to a safe place. Set rules for yourself and your household regarding texting and driving, lead by example. Currently there is no national ban on texting or using a wireless phone while driving, but a number of states passed laws banning texting or wireless phones requiring hands-free use of wireless phones while driving.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. ht ml.\\n\\n\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving.\" Federal Communications Commission, 10 May 2019, www. fcc. gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving.\\n\\n\"The Risks of Texting While Driving.\" Digital Responsibility, www. digitalresponsibility. org/risks-of-texting-while-driving.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nEveryday people die because of using their cellphones while driving. According to many articles and actual news articles phones are the top reason that cause car crashes. Study shows that a cell phone puts drivers in a very high risk of a car accident. People tend to use phones while driving to prevent them from being bored and because they want to keep in contact with someone at all times. People need to avoid these habits and stop texting while driving or even putting their phones on a free hand phone stand. It can cause people to be distracted, and in a blink of an eye, anything can happen.\\n\\nUnfortunately, people use their phone at the wrong time, while they are driving. It is very dangerous and can mess up your life in a blink of an eye. You may think \"oh i\\'ll be fine i\\'m aware of my surroundings\" but you never know who is around you and what type of crazy drivers there are on the road. Using a phone makes it harder to focus on the road, according to articles pedestrians pass away because someone made the wrong decision now they will unfortunately have to live with it. A car is not a toy, we have to understand that there is a time a place to use our phones. Most accidents are caused by teens under the age of 21, last year there were about 5,000 accidents mostly caused by teens.\\n\\nWhen people are using their phones it\\'s mostly at a traffic stop, they don\\'t end up paying attention so it holds everyone up then others get angry. Phones are a huge distraction it\\'s a habit we all need to break. In this generation they are now making cars that have a screen in the front that looks like a big Ipad, and hand free cars. Just imagine the distraction that will cause and the amount of car accidents as well. Electronics are getting very serious and they tend to be distracted very easily.\\n\\nNow that we get a clear understanding on what phones can do when we drive and what the effects are. We should start a no phones campaign to reduce the cellphone usage so it can reduce the amount of car accidents. We could give out information that shows people what could happen so they can think twice about texting and driving. And stricter laws should be in place for it. These types of things should be taken very seriously no matter the situation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it everyday and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others on the road. Leave the phone alone while you are driving because a text is not worth a life, that text will be there when you get to your destination.   ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nTeens, adults, and even officials are on their phones, the majority of the day. Although cell phones existence hasn't been very long they've seemed to be a huge impact on today's society. People tend to forget what they're doing outside the phone because of how much a distraction cell phone can be, which leads to accidents and injuries. Many people in today's world have picked up a bad habit of texting and driving and don't realize the fatal accident they have partaken. Texting and driving isn't just reckless it also shows how careless people are of others well being.\\n\\nTo begin, people should not be allowed to text and drive because of the dangers that it brings to the driver and other drivers around them. Texting takes your attention off the road which leads you to not notice things you may have been able to avoid if you were paying attention. Simple things such as slowing down because an animal is crossing the road instead of swerving off the street because of how late you noticed the situation due to the distraction of the phone. In addition to taking your focus off the road, texting and driving also limit your vision at night. When your driving at night the light from the phone can strain your eyes causing you not to be able to see when driving. The screen acts as a mini headlight which blinds the driver making you lose awareness of the road. Texting and driving can limit the abilities of the driver because of how drastic a distraction it can be.\\n\\nMeanwhile, you also benefit when you're not on your phone and you're aware of the road and everything around you. For starters, a lot of people driving don't realize some of the things they pass by every day because of the fact they're always looking down at their phones. For an example, you may drive useless miles to a gas station because that's the first one you see when you look up from your phone, when there may have been a gas station you missed on the way. Not only that but you stay sure that you're not in trouble with the law. If one is to be caught texting and driving by an official, in addition to legal consequences, the driver can then lose points on there license and/or can get their license suspended or revoked. Teens have been reported to lose their license because of texting and driving which then leads them to have to wait more years in order for them to obtain another one. Adults have gotten the license suspended which causes them to have taken off from work and/or their kids to get another license. Getting your license taken away from you is and having to take time to get another is wasteful and can be avoided easily if you just put your phone down.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting and driving is a serious matter. The consequences of texting and driving are serious and can the worst thing to happen to many of us. It can lead to your license being taken away from you, it can lead to a waste of gas and money, or more importantly, it can lead to very serious injuries. Put the phones down, the text or post can wait until your off the road.\\n\\n1            \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nEach year phones are getting more advanced, which makes them more addicting for society. This addiction has gotten so bad people use them while in the driver\\'s seat. According to the NLM and NIH they say, \"After declining from 1999 to 2005, fatalities from distracted driving increased 28% after 2005, rising from 4572 fatalities to 5870 in 2008\". This proves the idea that distracted driving is growing because of the popularity of phones. Phones should not be allowed during driving because it puts lives at risk, it sets a bad example for future drivers, and it increases the chance for a car crash which means more cost for car damages. All drivers should pay attention to the road to ensure they are ready to respond to any situation.\\n\\nAll drivers should leave their phones while driving because it puts lives at risk. As stated by the Miller and Zois law firm more and more people are dying from distracted driving accidents a year. In the article it says, \"The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year.\" The evidence given supports the idea that due to the use of phones being so popular the number of people in an accident increases and that many of these accidents could have been avoided if drivers had paid attention to the road. In an article made by TeenSafe, it provides an incident about a woman that killed and injured young children due to texting and driving. In the article it says, \"In May of 2017, Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving.\" This was a sad accident that was caused because of the use of phones while driving. The evidence shows that the use of phones while driving causes innocent drivers to turn into killers. Phones should not be used while driving since it causes lives to be lost.\\n\\nThe use of phones while driving should not be allowed because it spreads to the next generation. If the older drivers text while driving it shows newer drivers that it\\'s ok to do it. According to a survey done by Jama Pediatrics, many parents say that using phones while driving is bad but about half of them still do it. In the article, it states, \"Indeed, 52 percent of millennial parents (22 to 37 years old) and 58 percent of older parents said they thought it was \\'never\\' safe to text and drive..... But almost two-thirds of parents have read texts while driving, and more than half of them have also written texts, the survey of 435 parents in 45 U.S. states found.\" The evidence provided helps prove that parents are not providing exemplary performances for their kids who will one day grow up repeating the process. With this study done by Jama Pediatrics it stamps the idea that texting and driving should stop with the older drivers to make sure the future of driving is bright for the newer. The NHTSA has ways on lowering the rate of distracted driving crashes. As stated by the NHTSA they say, \"Parents first have to lead by example-by never driving distracted-as well as have a talk with their young driver about distraction and all of the responsibilities that come with driving. Have everyone in the family sign the pledge to commit to distraction-free driving.\" This is an important comment because the next generation of drivers wouldn\\'t now the exemplary way of driving if someone didn\\'t show them. If parents or other qualified drivers don\\'t teach kids the exemplary way to drive then lots of car accidents are going to happen and one of them might lose a life\\n\\nTexting and driving is a dangerous activity and should not be allowed because of the increased chance of a car crash and the cost of that crash. In any car accident it can cost a lot to repair the damages and if the driver is in continuous car accidents due to texting and driving the cost can double. According to Peachtree Financial Solutions they say, \"In the event that an individual is involved in an accident with substantial damage, the typical cost can run approximately $5000 to start and then quickly increase from there, depending on the specifics of the accident.\" This was included to show how much money a person could have to pay for in a car accident which could have been done by texting and driving. A study done by The Zebra on young drivers presents critical information. For example, the article says, \"Including the cost to people\\'s lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion - or 15 percent - of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. This number only goes up after your primary offense.\" The evidence shown explains that the cost of car crashes is very high. This can be best interpreted that getting into a car crash would not be beneficial to a person in a person in a car crash a situation which could be caused by texting and driving. If the cost of car crashes is constantly increasing each year then people shouldn\\'t be texting and driving because it causes car crashes.\\n\\nThe evidence shown above helps prove that phones are dangerous to use while driving because it puts lives at risk, sets bad examples for future drivers, and it increases the chance of a car crash which means a lot of money to pay for damage. It\\'s important to realize that if we don\\'t take more offensive action to stop texting while driving then it will ruin the lives of families. If we don\\'t stop this, the bad actions will carry on to the next generation and the next until we stop.\\n\\nIf we don\\'t stop this then car crashes will continue to occur and the price for the damage will skyrocket.

       " \"cellphones and driving\\n\\nCellphones and driving has a lot to do with each other in this day and age because so many drivers feel the need to text and drive or to be on their phones in general. The fact that so many car accidents come from texting and driving yet people still do it is sickening. A lot of people have died from other people's mistakes yet people still do it on an everyday basis which is very crazy to think about.\\n\\nI strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving. It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use or ticketed for talking on the phone while driving, their insurance premium is very likely to rise especially if their cause.\\n\\nPeople think they can drive good enough to have a conversation on the phone and still pay attention to everything else going on the road. In all reality no one on the planet is that good a driver to pay attention to everything going on around them and watch out for people while still texting or scrolling social media apps. Thank you for listening to what i had to say about cellphones and driving vehicles.\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " \"Texting and Driving\\n\\nThousands of people die every year from people driving and texting. Texting and driving should be banned because it puts other people's lives in danger.\\n\\nIf a person crashes his or her car while driving, insurance on their vehicle could go up. A car crash can also kill loved ones, people riding with the intention of getting to point A to point B can be dismissed because of a car accident and a careless driver.\\n\\nThe main reason why why people text while driving is because they are really addicted to their cellular devices. Careless drivers should not be allowed on the streets because it is very risky to other drivers out there. In a car crash, the person getting hit can be seriously injured or even worse, that person could lose their legs or die. The driver that was distracted by texting can also put his or her passengers lives at risk. Somebody inside the car could fly out the windshield as soon as the car hits, worse scenario is that there is a probability that the vehicle can catch on fire while the passengers and the driver are inside the vehicle.\\n\\nIn a vehicle, insurance can be expensive or cheap, but it depends on what kind of insurance the vehicle has. Full coverage is the best one, it can back up anybody that gets in a car accident. The liability insurance is good too, but it does not cover that much if a person gets involved in a car accident. So, going with full coverage should be the best choice. Insurance insures your vehicle, driving without insurance is illegal. If a person gets into a car accident, insurance is there to help but if a person was too busy distracted on their phone, the insurance payment will go up. A driver that gets him or herself into an accident and they were very distracted on their phone, there could be some bad consequences.\\n\\nGetting into an accident can cause serious problems to the vehicle getting hit. The vehicle can be totaled which means that the vehicle can no longer be driven. If the driver goes too fast and he or she has their family aboard, they could be seriously injured if they crash. Losing someone you love in a car accident can be devastating. Most people don't get to sleep right knowing that they killed someone they loved in a car accident due to a distraction on their phone. Some people don't even drive anymore knowing what they did to a loved one. Losing a family member in a car accident is very sad, and very disappointing to the driver.\\n\\nTexting while driving is very dangerous. It could put the driver's life at risk but when there is an emergency, the driver should be able to attend that emergency but a safe and lawful way. Let's say, that a family member is very sick and he or she doesn't have a vehicle to drive itself to a hospital and the only way to take that person to a hospital is by calling someone for help. If that person doesn't pick up the phone, the other person that's sick could die. Many would say that this is a reasonable excuse but risking the life of an innocent drier is not acceptable.\\n\\nTherefore, texting and riving should be illegal because insurance rates raise in price, it is against moral conduct, and it is the reason many people die. Distracted driving could be the cause of many fatalities but placing the phone down while driving could save millions. You would not want to live with the death of someone on your shoulders.    \",\n",

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to keep in touch with people. They also think that hands free is safe because they're driving with two hands.\\n\\nDangers of phones and driving\\n\\nFatal accidents related to cell phones and driving have risen dramatically over the years. It usually happens with people around 25 years or younger. 1 out of every 4 accidents in the U.S is caused by texting while driving. Answering a text while driving takes your attention away from the road for five seconds. If you're traveling 55 mph that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.\\n\\nRecorded Statistics\\n\\nNearly 390,000 injuries accrue each year caused by texting while driving. You are six times more likely to cause an accident by texting while driving drunk. Texting is by far the most dangerous cell phone related task. 94% of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74% support a ban of handheld cell phone use.\\n\\nConsequences of phones/driving\\n\\nGeorgia's driving law prevents text messaging and hand held cell phone use for all drivers. For drivers it is illegal to write, send, or read a text while driving.\\n\\nThe texting law applies to cell phones, tablets, messaging devices and laptops. First offense a motorist is looking at a fine for 50 dollars and a demerit. Second offense 100 dollar fine and two demerits. Thirds offense is 150 dollars and three demerits.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nEveryday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.

The correlation between phone usage and accidents is 1.6 million crashes every year. Many people don't see it as such a bad thing or a something that is so important but in reality it is. When you stare at your phone for just second while driving that can cause you to not pay attention to anything that can happen around you.\\n\\nIt's okay for people to use them when they are parked in a safe place away from where people can get hurt such as a parking lot or a driveway but if you are at a red light and you start to use it that is just as dangerous as actually driving and looking down at it. No circumstance should allow for anyone to use their phones while driving unless they are an emergency response vehicle such as police firefighters or emt. I hope people see and realize the dangers of driving while texting and see that the lives of others around them are just as important because anything can change in a split second.\\n\\nIf some people don't see the big problem of texting and driving, then they shouldn't have a phone or be allowed to drive. Many people die every day because of this problem and none realize how bad this problem is in reality. People need to stop using phones while driving and start thinking about the safety and presence of others around them.             \",\n",
       " 'Texting and driving\\n\\nCell Phones have become very important to our lives. People use their cell phones for everything; texting, talking and to get on social media. However, these everyday things become a distraction when it comes to driving on the roads. It has become a big issue in modern day America. As more teens text and drive, many cases of texting and driving have occured, resulting in a mass of avoidable lost lives.\\n\\nIn 2016, The national Safety council reported that 1.6 million car crashes a year are caused by reckless teen driving, most of which, are by texting and driving. Teens nowadays can\\'t even put enough effort into not using their phones for at least 20 minutes, and for what cost, their lives? There has to be a kind of restriction on texting, or any kind of activity on your phone, while driving.\\n\\nSome phones already offer some programs or apps that let you disable your phone while you drive. Drivesafe mode is a built in program that is available only on some phones. Although, most of the programs similar to Drivesafe mode, are supposed to be turned on by the user. This is simple to disregard, and most drivers don\\'t even know they have such kinds of apps on their devices.\\n\\nAs of 2019, most states have gone to the point where they feel the need to ban texting and driving by using the word of law. The state of georgia put in place the \"Hands -free phone\" law which only allows drivers to operate voice controlled devices whilst driving. Still, even with the price of a hefty fine, and in some cases, jail time, people still continue to text and drive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, a good solution to ending deaths and accidents by teens who text and drive, starts with the parents. Parents should monitor their teens phones while they are out. Not only does the technology of today let parents spy on their kids phones just to keep them out of trouble, but it will help keep them alive, too. Parents should keep track of their kids while they go out, and alert them to stop when they text and drive. No one can tell you better than your own parents to stay alive.   ',\n",

Now they do more than just call people, people video chat, play music, take pictures and even play games and stream movies. Nowadays it's mandatory to have a cellphone. Even if you are a child or a elderly person now it's normal to have a cell phone or a type of electronic device.\\n\\nbeing that there are different distractions for having a cell phone and that almost everyone on the planet owns one some people use their phone when they drive. Some drivers text and drive while others talk on the phone and drive which can lead to serious accidents. although cellphones are not the only reason that people get into car accidents. Some drivers eat while driving, smoke, or drink while driving so you can't blame cellphones for all the car accidents.\\n\\ndespite having huge benefits, cell phones have become a great concern and a major cause of road accidents. While driving and using cell phones, drivers are not giving their full attention to the road. because most governments have imposed restrictions on using cellphones while driving. even in some states it's illegal to even have your phone out while driving, for example in Georgia it's illegal to have your phone out while driving.      \",\n",
       " \"Drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Imagine having to spend time in jail or prison because you hit someone and they are harmed, in critical condition or worse, maybe even dead. Besides facing possible jail time, the guilt you would feel for that is unbearable. Which is why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.\\n\\nDriving while using a cellular device is illegal. Often times if an officer spots you using a cellphone while noticing you are driving, he or she will pull you over and give you a ticket. For one that's a silly reason for getting a ticket. Now money has to be spent to pay the fine all due to the fact that whatever was on your phone was so important. In some situations there may be an emergency that is that important, but if that's the case you pull over then use your cellphone. Especially if the situation is something that can make you panic, you shouldn't be driving while in a frantic state.\\n\\n1.6 million crashes a year are due to cellphones. That's a lot! More than what it should be, considering the fact it is against the law. Like I said before the guilt you would feel if you were the cause of someone's serious maybe fatal injury would make you feel horrible. Or imagine if something happened to your loved ones because someone was texting while driving.\\n\\nIf something on your phone may be very important and you feel the need to use your cellphone, then you should pull over into a parking lot or maybe the side of the road depending on the circumstances. Like I stated before if something tragic is happening and your getting a call of text about it the last thing you'd be worried about is the road. Which can can an accident or an almost accident. Or even when someone sends you something funny while your driving your not going to be focused on the road, your going to either be laughing or replying. Maybe even both.\\n\\nIn conclusion, don't let using your cellular device while driving cause you to be another statistic and have the 1.6 millions crashes a year go even higher. Which leads me to, once again, why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.                                      \",\n",
       " \"Drivers should not be using their phones while driving a vehicle. Over years, many people have been in a car accident due to using their phones while driving. Many times people are victims because they were not using their phones, but the other driver was. Some drivers do not think about the consequences, they do not think of other people's life. Using phones while driving can also be a reason a police officer can pull any driver over and give them a ticket. It is not just adults who do this, every year there are new teens driving and many of them may be using their phone while driving right now.\\n\\nIn a texting and driving statistics shows that nearly 390,000 accidents occur due to people texting and driving. In those thousands of accidents there are also some teens who were also in a car accident. Many deaths have happened during those accidents and it all happened just because we as humans seem to be too attached to phones and can not wait any longer to text back or to return a call. When drivers use their phones while driving, they have made a decision to make a distraction to themselves and take their eyes of the road.\\n\\nIn car accidents caused by using the phone while driving,there are also victims who do not use their phones, but end up in a accident. The driver who is using their phone will take their eyes off the road and may be likely to hit another car. Anyone can be a victim, they could just be walking and not notice or think anything bad will happen. Anyone who is driving should never use their phone while driving, they need to think about the consequences. They need to think as if they were the victim, and need to learn that being on their phone is not important.\\n\\nPolice officers will pull any driver over if they see them holding their phone, they will not care if the driver was using it or not. The officers are pulling them over before anything worse happens. If an adult gets pulled over they will receive a ticket from the officer or they may be under arrest if they do not have a license. If a teen gets pull over they will get points taken away from their driving permit and will also get a ticket. If people think about it, sending a text is not worth paying a ticket with the money that you could have bought something for themselves.\\n\\nDrivers using their phones while driving should think twice if it is worth it or not. They can lose their life and make someone else lose their life. They will also get pulled over and receive a ticket and lose money just for trying to reply to a text. Due to using the phones while driving many people have been in a car accident and many have lost their lives. Drivers should also think about others and how they can affect someone's life. People should know that the text can wait and that they can reply to a text when they have reached their destination.         \",\n",
       " \"Smartphones ,like every other piece of technology,have been a two edged sword. They have fused to us. They are the ultimate tool. They have saved lives. They have also caused many deaths. One study done by teensafe. com in 2019 found 26% of car crashes are related to cell phones. Most of these crashes were strictly because of texting. In order to limit deaths and make roads safer,handheld devices that distract the driver from the road should be prohibited while driving.\\n\\nThe first problem is that phones take up a lot of focus. Humans by design can only do one thing at once and this can be proven by a very simple experiment. Try to pat your stomach and rub your head around in a clockwise manner. This is difficult because every time you attempt to multitask,your brain is really switching back and forth repeatedly between the two tasks. This is very taxing on the brain. This presents the problem with texting and driving. when attempting to text and drive,you take attention off of driving putting the driver and everyone else around them in great danger.\\n\\nAnother problem is that holding a phone in your hand physically impedes on the mobility of the driver. In every driver's manual it distinctly states that every driver should place both hands on the steering wheel. If you don't have both hands on the steering wheel,you are much more likely to be unprepared for the fast decisions you will have to make as there is much less traction on the steering wheel. This also forces you to make a greater effort in order to move the steering wheel.\\n\\nSome argue that the use of phones has become essential to the average driver and that both activities require so much time that they must overlap on each other's time. I would agree with those people. I would say that the solution to the problem in that case are to only take away the use of handheld devices and allow the use of artificial intelligence,such as siri and alexa,and wireless headsets.\\n\\nThe problem of accidents due to handheld devices has been going on way too long. Awearness was not raised enough and people became complacent. I said before that 26% of car crashes happen because of phones,but the truth is that even 1% is too much. We can raise laws in order to stop this trend,but the truth is that this can only truly be diminished on an individual level through positive peer pressure and peer accountability. This means it start with you. lets make it cool to stay safe.   \",\n",

When people look at their phone no matter what they are doing it is messing with their vision. It's dangerous because when adults are driving and cannot see they are likely to hit someone or something. Not only could they possibly kill themselves but if there is a young child walking they could have their life taken over just a simple text message.\\n\\nWhen you add the many factors into adults driving and the dangers its imaginary. The light outside and how dark it is will be put into play, if the road is wet it'll make it slippery or even just other drivers. The life of an innocent child is much more important than any text message anyone could ever send. There are many different ways to make life easier and safer, such as Bluetooth and voice activated features. The world would most definitely be safer and much easier to live in if everyone did their part not to be distracted while they are driving.\\n\\nNo one wants to have to worry about having their child die by some distracted driver while they are walking but everyday kids get killed either on accident or on purpose. It happens and no one wants to admit it but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Just looking at your cell phone it takes your eyes away from the road just long enough for you to swerve and take out a little kid. No one really thinks of kids when they are driving around on the highway or a normal road but the children should always be on everyone's mind.\\n\\nIt is a terrible shame that the world and our ever growing economy does not care enough about our children and young adults to stay off their phone. While young adults themselves are a big part to blame for the recklessness and irresponsibly whilst driving we cannot put the blame on one group of children. Just like no one can put all the blame on adults we are all responsible for driving when we are and if anyone makes the tragic mistake of using their cellphone while it may not cause the death of them it may just very well be the cause of an unfortunate death      \",\n",
       " \"The Dangers of Texting and Driving\\n\\nIn today's time, we all want to stay connected to our family, friends, and loved ones, now even more than ever. With the boom in technology and smart phones, it is no surprise that just about everyone has one. With those advances, we are able to keep in touch and stay connected with everyone by calling, sending emails, using social media, and by texting. Even though it may be easy and convenient to stay connected, and even though there are many other positive effects of technology, there also comes many negative effects are there comes great dangers to include texting and driving. There are both positive and negative effects when driving as well, when adding texting and other distractions in while driving, the negative effects, and dangers are increased a lot more. Calling and texting while behind the wheel has become increasingly common for many drivers in today's society, and just as it can become common, it has led to many distractions, more accidents, and more fatalities.\\n\\nOne cardinal rule of driving has always been to keep both hands on the wheel. While driving, even with the car on cruise control, sometimes we forget how much of a risk we are taking as we are not only responsible for our car, we must stay protected and cautious of those around us as well. Even though we only think of the temporary satisfaction or benefit that we have from driving, we often don't think of how we put ourselves, other drivers, and pedestrians at risk. Driving requires a lot of focus and it requires our full and undivided attention. Texting and driving places you at risk because you are taking your eyes off the road, you are taking your hands off of the wheel, and evening more you are taking your mind off of driving. Distractions such as texting or even calling can cause some of the smallest or some of the most life threatening, life altering issues. It is no surprise that texting while driving takes your concentration off the road and with the distractions, even for a second, it could have consequences some minor, while others can bring on serious consequences. With just a second of texting, we can miss important signs or messages on the road, it can lead to speeding which can lead to very expensive tickets. In addition to speeding fines and tickets, distracted driving also leads to higher insurance premiums which add up to be a lot over time. To some, that risk may be minor, but another serious consequence for distracted driving is that it can lead to jail time. It does not matter how good of a driver you may think you are or how good your driving skills may be, unless you are capable of equally concentrating on multiple things at one time (which is not possible), you will be distracted when doing anything other than focusing on the road, and that places you and others at a serious risk.\\n\\nAccidents on the road can happen and anytime and for a number of reasons, but it is no surprise that if texting and driving leads to more distractions, those distractions also leads to more accidents and more fatalities. Over the years, as technology has advanced and with more ways to stay connected, combined with people that refuse to make the right decision, the rates and statistics of texting related deaths have drastically increased. While checking messages and emails, making phone calls, or even sending the shortest message, so many things can go wrong. Just the slightest distraction can cause someone to run off the road causing them to run off the road, hit another car, or even hit a pedestrian, Those distractions combined with high speeds, a tiny click of the finger can cause many to be critically injured or it can cause someone to lose their life. According to Luke Ameen, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United Stated are caused by texting and driving, 421,000 are injured in car crashed that have involved a driver who is distracted in some way, and 37,000 people die in auto accidents every year due to being distracted or texting while driving and those numbers are expected to increase over the years. Texting or reading a message takes your eyes off the road for a minimum of three seconds and within those short seconds someone can lose their lives or sustain life threatening injuries that they would have to live with for the rest of their lives. Even if all of those drivers are not at fault, they could have probably avoided the accident if they were not distracted by texting.\\n\\nIn an effort to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by distracted drivers, people can take simple steps to help save lives. Although auto accidents take place every day and for a variety of reasons, distractions seem to cause more of a problem so if we limit or stop the distractions we can prevent accidents and help to save more people. While driving it is important for people to save the distractions for later. People have been encouraged to put their phones on silent or to turn them off, they can put their phones out of their reach such as in the glove compartment, back seat, or their trunks, or they can take other measures such as downloading apps that would prevent them from using the phone when it has been detected that their vehicles are in motion. While these are just a few things that can be done, people should do what is best for them. While these actions may seem extreme to some, saving their life or the lives of others is more important. Most states and insurance companies have also put policies and other actions in place that will assist with reducing the number of fatalities causes by texting or distracted driving. Most states have provided discounts for safe drivers while other states are issuing fines and some go to the extreme of jail time if drivers are caught texting or using their phones while driving. When driving, we are faced with enough dangers. Even though we want to stay connected to our friends, family, and loved ones, all it takes is a few seconds to never be able to get that opportunity again. While behind the wheels, taking simple actions can help save our life or the life of others. There are several options that we can take to cause an accident and just the same, there are several options that can be taken to prevent them from happening as well.   \",\n",

Causing accidents can also lead to points being added to a driver's license which raises insurance costs even more and leads to certain restrictions being placed on the offender's legal driving abilities.\\n\\nIn The United States alone approximately 9 people die every day because of distracted drivers (cdc. gov). That's over 3,250 preventable deaths every year because someone decided not to put their phone down when getting behind the wheel. In 2016 alone, 1,500 people in Georgia died in car accidents due to phone related incidents and this number is expected to rise due to innovations in technology (ajc. com). Not only does this information prove how serious of a situation texting and driving is, but it also gives an idea of how much of an impact it is making on society. These alarming death numbers are unacceptable and could have been prevented.\\n\\nRamirez 3\\n\\nIn conclusion, not only is it expensive and illegal to use a phone and drive, but it can also lead to serious injury and even death to you, your passengers, other drivers, and even pedestrians. Although some might say that they needed to make an important call or send an important text message, the risks drastically outweigh the reasons to use a phone and drive.            \",\n",
       " \"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.\\n\\nThe first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.\\n\\nAlthough using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.\\n\\nIn addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This changes is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Texting and driving has become a huge problem throughout the world teens and adults alike. Most people when think it is no big deal and that they can do it as long as they get caught. They think well I am a good driver I won\\'t crash until it actually happens.\\n\\nFirst things first, people adults and teens should not under any condition be texting and driving. There is no excuse or any solid reason you should be doing it. We all think it isn\\'t like most people do it. People think its rare and not a big deal. Suprise suprise according to the article,\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\" the editor states,\"In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile\". This is a very startling fact. By the author saying this it means that at any given time 660,000 or more people are putting the lives of the people in the car and those around them in great danger.\\n\\nBy the same token, texting and driving takes the lives of many people around the world everyday. You would think with everyone being safe drivers and smart they wouldn\\'t wreck while texting and driving. The fact is according to the article,\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\" the author.\\n\\nstates,\"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year\". This statement made by the author is showing us how serious texting and driving is. Everytime someone picks up their phone they will possibly become another accident caused by texting and driving. Also in the article it states,\"Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk\". We all know how serious and dangerous drunk driving is so if texting and driving is more dangerous than that then we have a real problem on our hands.\\n\\nOn the other hand there are many ways we are trying to prevent texting and driving. Some cars come with a feature that allows you to receive and answer calls or even texts through your car without touching your phone at all. Some cars come with a ability to not start if it senses that the driver is using a cellular device. But there are many ways you can stop texting and driving without having to buy a new car. In the article,\"Tips for preventing texting while driving\" in this article the author states,\"Put your phone out of reach\" and \"Make a commitment to not use your phone while driving\". These are ways we can stop texting and driving. We need to end this problem once and for all because the longer we allow it the more lives that will be taken.\\n\\nAll things considered, we do not need to allow texting and driving bases on the evidence that has been shown here. Texting and driving causes more harm than good. We need to educate our young people and even our adults of the risk they are taking when they are texting and driving. Next time you are about to text and drive ask yourself if texting someone back is more important than somebody\\'s life, it can wait.   ',\n",
       " 'Proper Driver Cellphone Usage\\n\\nThe question of ¨ Should Cellphones be allowed to use while driving?¨, Is on the minds of many and it is believed that Cell phones should be used responsibly while driving to be able to stay safe and contact those you need to. Since Cellphones are storage for information to use and a fast way to contact anyone you want or need to at any time. However, Cellphones are also methods of distractions for those driving, leading to car crashes which causes injury and death.\\n\\nKeeping both these in mind Cellphones should be used while driving but only to a certain degree.\\n\\nWithout a restriction on Cellphone usage, the results may be disastrous. A record in 2017 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States(¨\\n\\nCell Phones ¨). Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent(¨ Cell Phones ¨). There is also the fact of high school students who reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive, and typing text messages reduces a driver\\'s ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles(¨ Cell Phones ¨).\\n\\nWith all these dangers present when you use your phone and drive it\\'s hard to see why people should be allowed in any way at all. Sadly the world is not and will never be that black and white. For those using their phones, there could be a plethora of reasons including Contacting bosses and appointments to state a late arrival, contacting family and friends for important news or updates, and more. Granted, reasons may also include just wanting to converse with others and update their social media but in this day and age, more teens will be doing just that. Luckily there is a way to do all of these and still maintain a safe driving ability and that is by using Bluetooth and vocal activation/response. These features in cars and phones allow you to text back and read messages through your phone or your car just by speaking back. There is also the ability to call via Bluetooth and speak verbally while still focusing on the road and still checking in with your boss, coworkers, family, and friends.\\n\\nIt\\'s no longer a matter or should or should not but a matter of how. The dangers of cellphone usage while driving is apparent in everyday life and in the shocking statistics of the matter and yet it still happens. With the technology available and proper rationale it is possible to get the best of both worlds, you can contact others for any reason and also be able to drive safely on the road. Therefore, cell phones should be allowed while driving but only to a certain degree; which is the hands\\' free talk and text available to you via car Bluetooth or voice recognition on your cellular devices.\\n\\nWorks Cited Page\\n\\n\"Cell Phones.\" Teen Driver Source, 25 Oct. 2019, https://www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones.

       " \"Responsible Drivers\\n\\nThe share of American adults that own smartphones is now 81%, up from just 35% in pew research center. Most of the 81% is responsible adults around the United States, so that means they are responsible enough to know how to use a phone in a car. I think that should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nDrivers should be able to use phones while driving the car because, now a days there is a Bluetooth in cars that most drivers can connect their phone in once they have gotten in. Once that happen people can answer the phone without picking up their cell phone and having to hold it up to their ear, instead it will just sound off through the car.\\n\\nAnother reason I think that drivers should be able use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because, many people do follow the rules and not answer the phone and not text while driving but, what if it what an emergency that has occurred but, people don't want to answer the phone because they don't want to get caught. People should be able to pick up a phone during an emergency because, if it were a family emergency, I would want to pick up the phone up as soon as possible.\\n\\nOverall my understanding would be that People should be able to use cell phones while driving, not many people would say it's safe but when it comes down to being responsible, I think people like that, that know how to manage their time on the phone and as cautious as could be , with a Bluetooth speaker in their car would be good source to use instead of having to pick up the phone and having to put it up to your ear in making it notice , but if you are as responsible as people who know how not to pick up a phone you should try using Bluetooth in your car for you can start using it.\\n\\n.      \",\n",
       " \"Texting and Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.\\n\\nIn essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nWe use our cell phones for just about anything and everything to include; texting, talking to our loved ones, and connecting with the rest of the world via social media. Cell phones have become a natural way of life to where we pick up our phones and use them like second nature. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. If all states ban the use of cell phones while driving, then there would be a reduced amount of fatalities each year.\\n\\nPeople use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.\\n\\nIf you are driving at 55 mph for 5 seconds in that amount of time you could cross a football field. People don't understand how dangerous distracted driving really is. All states should have some sort of legal parameters of what happens when you get caught using your cell phone while driving. People should get a stronger/ harsher punishment for the use of a cellular device while driving. People are way more impaired when you are distracted and driving than you are drinking and driving. The problem with this is that so many people do it and it is so unbearable hearing so many stories of how many people die every year because they make the mistake.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.    \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Cars\\n\\nCars are a very expensive item in life and are used for everyday transportation. Phones are somewhat an important necessity and play an important role in many of our lives. Combined together has always been a horrible idea but many believe that they should be allowed to be on the phone while operating their vehicle. Cars and Phones should never be allowed together because of the many risks it could cause to the safety of many people.\\n\\nCars were created as another way of transportation and take you basically anywhere you need to go, throughout the year's many car companies have improved the technology that goes into the cars to make them more safe and reliable for the customers. New features have made cars super safe but many people tend to use their personal electronics while driving and it can lead to many incidents. Cars do a lot in everyday life and when people decide to use their phones while driving it causes many bad and sometimes deadly accidents. Many casualties are sometimes blamed on the car companies for the accidents but more investigation shows that many car accidents are caused by distracted drivers that use their phones whilst operating their vehicles. Car companies have been made to pay millions in lawsuits because of people not taking responsibilities and putting their phone down rather being distracted and still finding a way to beat the system to sue the car companies.\\n\\nPhones are an important essential that many that have the privileges to have and provide so much for everyday life. The technological advantages that many phone companies like Samsung and Apple have put new technology that offers the driver to turn on driving mode which basically turns off every notification. This is very helpful and very useful because it helps the driver is more focused on the road and less distracted with his or her phone. Phones used to only be household items that were usually kept on the walls of the homes and usually could only be used in the homes. Phones were very essential to those who were fortunate enough to have them because they were able to communicate with family and friends across the country. However, those who could not afford phones were not fortunate enough to buy them whereas those who could have the opportunity to do anything.\\n\\nPhones and Cars have never been a good idea combined together because of the many risks it carries. On average, deaths caused by cell phone usage whilst operating a vehicle is roughly above 1.6 million deaths per year. People do not realize how dangerous it is to operate their vehicle while being distracted and they take it for granted because in a split second that can all be taken from you in the snap of a finger. Many argue that they can multitask and use their phone whilst operating their vehicle. Although, car companies have made attempts to improve the technology for drivers to become less distracted but they still distract themselves.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that Cars and phones should never be allowed together but there is no way to prohibit cellular phones and it's tragic but if we made an effort to cut down on this distraction there will be a change in that number of deaths.   \",\n",
       " 'Texting and Driving Policy\\n\\nA driver should not have a phone in his hand while driving because it can turn into a bad situation. People now with this new technology are getting new phones every year. People shouldn\\'t be able to have their phones in there cars for any purposes unless its an emergency or if someone is in the passenger seat. Cell phones should never be used while driving, because they can cause accidents.\\n\\nPeople nowadays are on their phones while driving, which is not a good thing to do. Cell phones should never be used while driving, operating equipment, or in any situation where they can cause accidents. Although some people support using their phones while driving, there is evidence that driving, texting, and talking on the phone is a dangerous thing. People\\'s conversations can cause an accident and turn into something unpleasant. If People text while driving, they can hit another pedestrian while just sending one text or answering the telephone.\\n\\nDriving while texting is a dangerous thing to do because it can cause deaths. Texting while driving can harm or even kill a person, unless a person has a Tesla or any other car that can drive itself. According to Livescience, \"cell phone distraction causes 2,600 deaths and 330,000 injuries in the United States every year.\" Also, at any given time, \"10 percent of teenagers who are driving are talking or texting\" (Livescience). This research indicates that thousands of people are dying and injured by looking or using their phones.\\n\\nAnything can happen in seconds just by looking at a cellphone screen when driving or operating equipment. When a driver is distracted by their phone, they can cause accidents as well as death to themself or others. People say texting and driving is similar if not worse than drinking and driving. Both can hinder the ability to properly drive or maintain the rule of the road. Several states have banned phoning and texting while driving, particularly for new or inexperienced drivers.                                                                                ',\n",

There's more and more teenagers on the road now, accident rates have been rising ever since. Teens from this generation are so addicted to their cell phone it's a huge distraction behind the wheel. People should not use cell phones while driving because you're risking someone and your own life, it's illegal, texting and driving delays a driver's reaction time.\\n\\nText messaging requires the driver's eyes off the road, studies show that teenagers are by far the biggest culprit of text messaging while driving. Making it dangerous for them and other drivers, since teens have the least amount of experience behind the wheel. In other cases many drivers keep their eye of the road to dial a number, this can have disastrous results for others and pedestrians. People don't realize that accidents can happen in a split second, in those few moments that your eyes are on a cell phone you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or a vehicle braking suddenly in front of you. Texting and driving is a dangerous habit we should avoid it to prevent injuries and death.\\n\\nDriving and using a cell phone has become a big theme here in the United States, texting and driving is banned for all drivers in 47 states. Talking on a hand held cell phone while driving is banned is 16 states and the district of columbia. Yet these bans did not stop people from using their cell phones. Fines and license suspension have been put in place. A fine for a first offense is\\n\\n$25, $50 for a second offense, $75 for a third offense. These fines can be as low as $20 and as high as $10,000 depending of the state. Jail time only for a misdemeanor charge, loss of license in some cases involving injuries. State laws should be more strict on these things, because drivers don't take these punishments serious. Punishments need to increase so that drivers can take it serious and will stop using cell phones.\\n\\nAccording to statistics using a cell phone while driving delays driver's reaction time, using a cell phone reduces their visual scanning of the road ahead, and have a higher chance weaving through their lane and are slower to respond to hazards. A study found that hand-held phone can delay by 46%, sending a text slows it down by 37%. By comparison using cannabis slows it down by 21%, and drinking to the legal amount by 13%. An average time to reply to a text message is 4.6 seconds and while going 45-55 miles per hour that's enough to cover a soccer and football field. Studies show that a person of the age of 20 reaction time slows down while being on the phone is as equal as a 70 year old man.\\n\\nThe problem of using cell phones while driving can be eliminated. It might take time and effort, but we can't slip this problem through our hands, because it's dangerous. You risk people and your own life, it's illegal, it delays driver's reaction time.         \",\n",

Drivers and passengers have to be very careful on the road these days, even with some of the new laws that have been put in place. Although some people think it is okay to talk on the phone while driving because they claim to be good at multitasking, however, it is not due to the number of car accidents, the number of injuries, and the number of deaths.\\n\\nIn all the united states there been more than 100,000 people than get injured in a car accident and According to EdgarSnyder. com \"Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\"Accidents are due solely to the use of your phone or any distraction, but only when using the phone while its handling can cause a lot of damage, such as having a car accident, etc. Everything that can happen with just using your phone while driving. and because you were not paying attention to the road while you were driving because you were busy playing with your phone, texting, or playing a game.\\n\\nThis is one of the many car accidents and reasons why you should not use your phone while your driving. You may have an accident with another car simply by being on your phone the moment you drive a car and you will not know if there are children in the car that crashed, you will not know if you died in the accident, apart if you die in the accident that caused, will be sued with long-term charges in jail for the crime of using the cell phone while driving because you broke the law by using your phone.

One average, people spend about 5 hours a day on their cellular device according to Rescue Time Research Company. No matter where we go we usually have our cellphones, and whenever it makes any noise or alerts you of something, the average person's response is to immediately respond with utmost urgency, sometimes disregarding our surroundings. When we are driving sometimes this distraction causes tragedies that could have been easily avoided if we were to simply avoid use of our phones while driving. The use of cellphones while driving in any capacity is something that should not be allowed under any circumstances because it is a dangerous distraction while driving.\\n\\nDriving on public roads in the United States of america is already a privilege that most of the population takes for granted. With 68% people in the united states having the ability to drive, it is crucial that the safety of every person and vehicle on the road is kept up to standard and that the driver of the vehicle is responsible for the safety of themselves as well as others on the road. When a driver picks up the phone they immediately break focus of the road leading to increased chances of a crash or accident. The privilege of driving should not be treated carefully and not violated by use of a cell phone. Texting while driving is already illegal and its apparent why, so why not apply the same rule to overall use of a cellphone.\\n\\nDriving is a privilege that is given to everybody, but can be revoked under any circumstances if the government feels it is needed. One of the main reasons for the citation of use of a cellphone while driving is because it is a danger to oneself but also a danger to other drivers on the road. Sence cell phone use impairs the attention of the road, accidents where people are injured are more likely to occur. Even though you may be aware of what you're doing while driving, another big factor is paying attention to what other drivers are doing. When you are using a cellphone in any way, you are less likely to see these potential dangers.\\n\\nOne of the leading causes of early death is due to car accidents, and many times a cellphone plays a role in why an error was made which caused a crash. The price of ones life is worth much more than a notification from a cell phone. and endanger their own life as well as the others around them solely for their benefit is wrong. That is something that should be outlawed and forbidden under any circumstances. Safety is the number one priority when driving and using a cellphone while driving is one of the most unsafe practices to do while driving. Endangering others is never worth more than looking at a notification from your cell phone.\\n\\nThe use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed anywhere and strict restrictions should be set in place all over the world to stop the use of cellphones while driving. Using a cellphone in any way while driving increases your chances of an accident and not only endangers the life of you, but also the other drivers on the road. Using a cellphone while driving is not worth the potential risk.   \",\n",

Sadly, people are choosing the wrong time to be on their cell phone and that time is when people are driving. Today's society, people are more worried about their phone more than their personal safety and the safety of other people in the vehicle because people don't know when to put their phone down. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones while driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.\\n\\nBillions of people all over the world are using cell phones daily in their life routine. Cell phones have different features including games, music , and cameras etc. However, observations, experience, and studies have highlighted the dangerous effects of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts attention of the driver. Cell phones have become a concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers that uses their cell phone are not able to give their complete attention on the road are causing danger to the other people on the road.\\n\\nCell phones during reduces the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle the phone and the vehicle at one time. The understanding, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on the cell phone during driving.

Driving is already dangerous and many people die almost every day from car crashes, or car malfunctions. So adding a mobile device that already has so many disadvantages and makes your health worse, is just bad. Cell phones on an average can bring soreness of eyes, and blurred vision, and headaches. If that\\'s not enough you can even get a type of an eye cancer.\\n\\nUsing Cell Phones are very dangerous and can cause serious issues while putting it with Driving. Drivers should be off their phone while operating a vehicle as such, no matter if it\\'s a car, a truck, or a motorcycle, no driver should.\\n\\nThere are three reasons as to why I think drivers should not use a cell phone while driving but the first one is for the drivers\\' safety themselves. The drivers\\' safety is the most important. \"Distracted Drivers\", which means they are doing something else while not paying attention to the road, is one of the main causes of the accidents. 27% percent of adults admit to texting while driving, according to esurance. com, 24% percent Of fatal car crashes are adults are aged 30 to 39 were also involved with cell phone use. What I\\'m referring to this information for is because adults are supposed to be, or at least traditionally the responsible ones. You would think that they would put the phone down but no they text and drive or even talk on the phone while driving.\\n\\nWhich is putting their life at risk. If you are driving you are handling an over 40 ton machine which has a lot of speed on it, even for a truck. So when you add additional stuff like a text, which can wait until u get home or at a stop you\\'d rather, get yourself killed and most likely others. You\\'re basically, if it\\'s a fatal car crash then, killing yourself which is suicide.\\n\\nYou\\'re taking yourself away from your family which is not right.\\n\\nMy next point is that you\\'re not only taking yourself, but additionally your taking someone else away from their family. Which is murder, and murder is really bad especially if you live the car crash and you are the one who was on their phone, YOU will be sentenced to life in prison or maybe even worse just because YOU couldn\\'t put the phone down. According to edgarsnyder. com, 390,000 injuries occur each year, just from using cellular devices while driving.\\n\\nBut this is the more disturbing fact, 11 teens are killed EVERY single day in the United States. That\\'s a scary number and considering those are not just from people texting and driving but the innocent are killed. This is basically proof that cell phones are killing machines and should be inaccessible while operating a motor vehicle. Just imagine irresponsibly texting on your phone and not thinking of the safety of others. Then BOOM, you have just killed young boy or girl in their late teens driving home from a job or restaurant and whom may have had more people in their car.\\n\\nThen the person parents have to hear that their child was killed due to your irresponsibility. It\\'s just really sickening and depressing.\\n\\nThe third and final reason as to why cell phone use should not be allowed while driving is because it\\'s just costly. Georgia passed the law on June 1st 2018. The fine will be 50$ and it will be doubled your second offense, according to USA Today\\'s Article on the new founded law. Distracted driving is a main problem in today world. It has come to a certain point in today\\'s America to where WE as a people need a law on not using our cellular devices. It should already be put in your mind after so many lives of young teens and adults\\' lives have been lost. But that\\'s not good that you have to pay a fine and on top of that if you get caught in an accident, you will have to either be sued by the victim of the car crash or you will have to pay for expense on your car insurance. As an adult especially paying your bills and having to deal with a fine of $50. That is just unnecessary. According to CreditDonkey. com The average an adult spends money on groceries is $400. $400 is an absurd number for groceries, so just imagine getting sued and paying a fine and even on top of that paying car insurance. You my friend have just dug yourself in a huge hole that is going to take a while on.\\n\\nTo conclude, Using your cell phone is and should be banned and illegal. It is a hazard to others and should be taken with seriousness. You are not only putting yourself at risk but many others. Everyone knows that your phone is an addiction and it is just something we do off impulse but that is no excuse. Train your brain to say no and put the phone down. The text or phone call is not nearly as important as driving on the road is and I hope people will start to realize the importance of this topic and will consider it in their own lives, Will You?

       " \"1\\n\\nDriving with phones\\n\\nDriving with phones has been a problem going on for a while. People have been arguing whether you should be allowed phones or not while in control of a moving vehicle, you should not be allowed to drive while on your phone because that distracts you from focusing on the road and all the traffic infront of you. You would be more focused on what's happening on your phone rather than what's going on in front of youon the road which could end up in you getting into a bad wreck and hurting yourself or even someone else. It would also end in you getting charged for it because you aren't allowed to have any distractions while driving. When you think og driving with phonesyou should only think of bad things because it never usually ends well if you are on the phone while also in control of a vehicle.   \",\n",
       " \"Cells Phones have an affect on everyone's life.People use their cell phone for almost everything such as:texting,talking,planning things,etc.Some people can do a lot with their cell phone in their hand.Everyone is always focused on their phone because phones are important to everyone.Being on cell phones while driving is a serious safety risk.\\n\\nWhen your on your cell phone while driving you forget that your driving because your trying to text.Being on cell phones while driving is not safe you can have a car crash and hurt the other person you hit.Most of Car crashes come from when people on their phone and not paying attention to driving.It is very dangerous for everyone if you be on your cell phone while driving.\\n\\nDrivers should not be allowed to be on cell phones while driving.Drivers try to drive and text at the same time and that's how people get hurt.If drivers are not allowed to use their phone it will help to not have so many accidents.Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things to do on the road.Any distracted driving can get you in accident because your not focused on driving.\\n\\nTexting and driving is just like drinking and driving it's very dangerous.Everyday it's a car accident most of the time it's because somebody is texting and driving.Some drivers can text and drive without being in a car accident but it's still not safe for the people who were in the car with and the people on the road.It's all ages texting and driving not just teens and not just adults.\\n\\nTexting and driving shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.It's a danger to everyone it should be banned.People get hurt and killed from car crashes.Texting while driving is a choice and people should pick the safest thing to do when driving and texting while driving is not safe at all.That's my opinion for texting and driving.   \",\n",
       " 'Over the past 4 decades cell phones have evolved extremely.\\n\\nNowadays people use their phones for just about any and everything. Things such as texting, calling, playing games, booking appointments, even checking latest posts on social media and much more. Cell phones started to become a problem when people were just looking down at their phones while crossing the street. Something that could be fixed. Now, people are choosing to use their phones while driving which has become an issue and is very dangerous. Which puts not only the driver in danger put others as well.\\n\\nEach day people are dying or being injured from using their cellular devices while being behind the wheel. Each year 421,000 people in the United States are injured due to a driver being distracted by their device. It\\'s more common for teens and young adults to text and drive (ages 18-24). 14% of fatal crashes are involved from texting and driving in this age division.\\n\\nIn 2017 the \"Hands Free Law\" had been issued. Which means drivers are allowed to use hand free devices only while being behind the wheel of a car and being completely free of a device. Although people may think the hands free law has prevented less accident it hasn\\'t it only makes people have the urge to reach for their devices even more. 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T\\'s Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it\\'s dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway.\\n\\nIn conclusion I strongly disagree with texting and driving because it puts more than one person in danger. I feel as if you need to use your device while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle be mindful and pull to the side. Weather it\\'s for making a quick call or sending a quick message even typing in a location into the GPS pull over because anything could happen in the blink of an eye.

       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nEveryone sees drivers using their phones, but most people don\\'t notice that sometimes it\\'s you. Mobile devices have taken over during this technological era. The majority of people have and enjoy using phones. Whether they\\'re looking at the newest post from someone on social media or texting a friend, family member, or stranger. Phones have the ability to keep people occupied for long or short periods of time. Using phones is okay until it comes to driving while using them. It turns into a whole new scenario where the user is gambling with their life with every tap, swipe, or click. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones for any reason while operating a motor vehicle; it puts you and others lives in danger, it is equally as bad as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and it\\'s illegal in most states.\\n\\nDistracted driving by the use of cellphones alone causes 2,600 deaths yearly. About 330,000 minor or major driving injuries too. Using mobile devices while driving impairs your ability to operate a motor vehicle. Forcing you to take your eyes off the road and focus your attention on it rather than the environment around you. Even if it\\'s just for a couple of seconds, this can be devastating and lead to serious injury. Studies show that drivers who just talk to someone on a cellphone rather than texting respond to emergency braking situations 18 percent slower than if not. Imagine if these drivers were texting rather than just talking, putting their attention more into the message they\\'re sending rather than the road in front of them. An emergency braking situation could be tragic for these drivers and lead to serious injury to them and the drivers in front and behind them. This shows that distracted driving can be devastating to you, and for the people in the vicinity. The danger caused by distracted driving is on par if not worse than driving under the influence.\\n\\nDriving under the influence is seen as the sin of all driving, but is it really? A study done by Harvard University found that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was very similar to driving distracted. 40 patients, nine percent of distracted drivers drove slower before breaking. 24 percent displayed an inability to keep pace with other cars because of the constant shifting of their attention. The same study found drunk drivers drove \"a bit\" slower than distracted and undistracted divers. With a serious increase of aggression, they pace cars more closely and more likely to break only seconds before a collision could occur. They also hit their breaks 23 percent harder than distracted and undistracted drivers. All participants had a BAC higher than 0.08 percent. The zebra\\'s 2017 study states in 2015 drunk driving caused more deaths, while distracted caused more accidents. 10,265 drunk driving deaths vs 3,477 distracted driving deaths. 290,000 injuries caused by drunk driving vs 391,000 injuries caused by distracted driving. While drunk driving caused more deaths distracted driving caused more injuries, injuries that have the possibility of leaving permanent damage on the victim\\'s body. Ruining innocent people\\'s lives impeding what they once were good at just because a driver-focused their attention on their phone rather than their surroundings. States are now taking action against distracted driving to attempt to stop or at least cut down on driving accidents.\\n\\nCurrently, 48 states have banned texting and driving. Washington was the first state to ever pass any form of texting ban, doing it in 2007. 20 states have banned handheld cellphone use. No state has banned complete cellphone use, but 38 states have banned all cellphone use for teenagers who are operating the vehicle. All states who pass these laws all have a common goal. To lower distracted driver accident ratings for the state at hand, but do the laws work? Yes and no, California cell phone usage dropped 57% from 9.3% of drivers to 3.3% using their cellphones after the ban on handhelds in 2008. Even if the usage of cellphones dropped the crash ratings haven\\'t this is where the no comes from. Bans in New York hope to see a decline in crash ratings, but there was basically no difference. The reason being drivers switched from handheld devices to using the car\\'s new built-in interfaces to interact with the outside world. The new built-in interfaces aren\\'t any safer like the companies claim they are and are just as bad when it comes to causing accidents. Banning the use of cellphones while driving did work because the use of actual cellphones dropped, but with new car technology allowing cellphones to connect to the car\\'s interface the risk and threat of distracted driving is still just as bad.\\n\\nDriving distracted isn\\'t okay, and it never will be. It\\'s the root of a majority of driving accidents. It can cause injury to you and the people around often fatal. It can even cost someone their life. It isn\\'t as life-threatening as driving under the influence, but it\\'s still dangerous.\\n\\nDriving bans have lowered ratings cellphone use while operating a vehicle, but they still fail in stopping accidents. No matter how many laws are pushed or lives are taken driving distracted is here to stay unless something major changes. Car manufacturers are creating new technology that makes it easier than ever to drive distracted. It\\'s a losing battle and it only gets worse by the year. Drivers shouldn\\'t drive distracted, yet they still do, accidents happen every day. Just try to make sure you aren\\'t on the giving end and hope that you aren\\'t on the receiving.\\n\\nPhones & Driving Citations\\n\\n\"On The Road.\" Distracted Driving, www. nsc. org/road-safety/safety-topics/distracted-driving.\\n\\nRogers, Mike. \"Facts About Cell Phones and Driving: Safe Driving Facts.\" Drive, 20 Nov. 2018, www. drive-safely. net/cell-phones-and-driving/.\\n\\nEssex, Amanda.

       " \"Why Drivers Should or Should Not Use Cell Phones While Driving\\n\\nI strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.\\n\\nOne main reason is because you can cause a wreck. You can cause a wreck by being distracted by your cell phone due to looking down at it and not paying attention to the road. You can easily run a red light or a stop sign. When a wreck occurs the driver's negligence is liable for the accident victim's damages. Those are victims entitled to compensation for damages directly resulting from the collision. A crash typically happens in less than 5 seconds in the real world. Using your cell phone in one hand and driving with the other is another cause of a wreck. To prevent this from happening, drivers should use hands-free objects such as headphones, Bluetooth from car, and a car mount/windshield cell phone holder.\\n\\nSecond, you're putting your life at risk. You're putting you're life at risk because you could end up in a bad car accident. You might live; You might die. You never know. You are decreasing your awareness of the road leading to more car crashes. Texting and looking down at the phone distracts you twice as much as a phone call. This can cause various accidents and represent a danger to the physical integrity of the occupants of the car and also serious injuries.\\n\\nLastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed. Phone cause accidents. Someone could send you a message and you can take one little glance at it and you can have an accident right then and there. Social media distracts you as well, scrolling and looking down at your phone can cause a distraction and can also make you have a wreck. By the time you get down looking up from that device, you'll probably have already hit someone else's car. Phones are not more important than you losing your life. Put cell phones away and pay attention to the road. You don't want to end up injured or dead from something you can easily avoid while on the road. You'd rather be safe than sorry. They have multiple objects you can use for cell phones. You can use the cell phone holder. You stick it on your car's dashboard and it holds your cell phone so you can watch the road or maybe your car has Bluetooth in it and you can talk/text while driving at the same time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.   \",\n",
       " 'Today, we use our cell phones for just about anything and everything to include; texting, talking to our loved ones, and connecting with the rest of the world via social media. Cell phones have become a natural way of life to where we pick up our phones and use them like second nature. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. If all states ban the use of cell phones while driving, then there would be a reduced amount of fatalities each year.\\n\\nTexting and driving according to the National Safety Council, is responsible for 1.6 million accidents per year and 11 teen deaths every day according to the Ins. Institute for Highway Safety Administration. For drivers between the ages of 18 and 20, there were 13% that admitted to texting or talking on the phone at the time of the accident. While overall, 34% admitted to texting while driving, 52% admitted to talking on the phone while driving (Marino, 2012). A few seconds is all it takes to end your life or the life of someone else. On the road, Americans hold their lives and the lives of other drivers at risk because they are anxious to check how many likes their picture got or what plans they have for that night. These are things that can wait until you safely reach your destination. Many would agree that they are able to multitask while driving, to include answering calls, checking social media, and texting while driving, but the proof is in the statistics. Most people know that the usage of cell phones while driving is a dangerous thing to do, but they think they can do it safely this one time, but it\\'s one of the major challenges.\\n\\nDistracted driving is anything that takes your eyes or mental focus off the roadway. It can be as simple as sending a text message, answering a phone call, or reaching for something in the car. These are some of the distractions that we as Americans face on a day to day basis. Loosing focus of the road even for a brief moment can end in catastrophe. For example, if a driver is going at a rate of 55 mph and decides to check a text message, in 5 seconds they can drive the length of a football field before regaining focus on the road (Marino, 2012, p1). In this situation, this distraction can be the difference between life and death. Talking on the phone may not seem like a distraction; however, in reality it is far more than that. With new technology development, newer cars are now equipped with hands free Bluetooth. In my opinion, car manufactures should continue innovate and develop operational equipment in cars to make the danger factor of talking on the phone while driving non-existent. Lastly, multi-tasking is a distraction that most of the time goes unnoticed. From putting on makeup, eating fast food, to searching for items in the car, these are daily tasks we do in the car without thinking about it. What we don\\'t realize, is that we are still putting our lives and the lives of others at risk by trying to multi-task while driving. 93% of rear end collisions occurred because the driver of the following car removed their eyes from the road 3 seconds prior to the collision (Bagg, 2006).\\n\\nSome Americans would agree that all states should have stiffer laws when it comes to texting and driving. Currently, nine states including Washington D.C, and the Virgin Islands have banned drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving, while no states have completely banned all cell phone use, thirty states, and Washington D.C. have banned cell phone use by new drivers and teen drivers. Furthermore, another thirty-five states, Washington D.C., and Guam, have banned texting while driving.\\n\\nAlthough many cities have passed distracted driving bans, there are some states that refuse to enact those laws to include Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Oklahoma. Opponents would agree that the more states banning distracted driving laws, the more safe our roadways would be (Albanesius, 2011). Distracted driving is a very serious offense and can carry severe sentences behind this madness. In some states, such as Massachusetts, distracted driver, which causes a death or injury can be charged with vehicular manslaughter which can be punishable up to 30 days in jail and fines ranging from $300-$3,000 and a license suspension for fifteen years. For example in 2012, an 18 year old, Aaron Deveau was texting while driving and the car he was driving crossed over into the center lane and hit an oncoming vehicle driven by a 55 year old male, which resulted in his death. This is just many of the documented fatalities that distracted driving causes and some would agree that there should be more severe consequences (McCarthy, 2015). Opponents think that creating laws banning someone from using cell phones while driving, would just make drivers mad and they would feel like this is an infringement of their rights as American\\'s. One way we can eliminate distracted driving is to install a no-texting app on your cell phone which can alert an incoming caller sending them an automated message saying, \"Sorry I can\\'t take your call right now, I\\'m driving\" or an app that cuts teen\\'s cell phone service while driving. Sprint and AT&T are two of the cell phone providers that offer anti-texting apps (Professional Safety, 2013).\\n\\nWhile cell phones are a huge benefit and can make life easier, let\\'s not forget that distracted driving affects the lives of many every day from injuries to death. Keep our roadways safe by just putting your phone down and staying focused.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving: Why They Don\\'t Mix\\n\\nCell phones: most people have one in this day and age. With this prolific use of cellular devices throughout the modern world, they can be observed in almost every aspect of daily life. Roadways are no exception, which is a problem for both those using phones, and drivers nearby who aren\\'t on their phones. While most states in America have banned texting and driving, many still allow limited or hands free use of cell phones. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while on the roads; it endangers them, as well as drivers surrounding them.\\n\\nDistracted driving is a major cause of driving-related accidents in the United States (26% of all car crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles). 9 people a day are killed, and another 1000 injured as a result of distracted driving.\\n\\nThis a big problem especially amongst young people. 42% of teens admitted to texting and driving in 2015, and it is the leading cause of death in teenagers. The dangers of mixing cellular devices and driving are evident.\\n\\nThere is one very key reason that cell phones are a dangerous proposition in vehicles: focus. When driving, focus on the road and your surroundings is paramount. Having one\\'s phone nearby leads the mind astray, and takes away from that ever so important focus. With the high speeds that are driven at today, one mistake leads to an accident. One mistake leads to serious injury and/or death in many cases. There are 3 different types of distractions present while driving: visual, manual, and cognitive distractions. Cell phone use is especially detrimental in this scenario because it embodies all 3. A phone takes your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheel, and your mind away from driving; a deadly trifecta. It is well known, why cellphones are a danger, and the effects they have had on roadway safety, now appropriate action must be taken to combat this crisis.\\n\\nTexting and driving has been banned in 47 of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Of those, only 15 states ban completely hand held use of cell phones while driving. Not enough is being done to combat this problem; in spite of these steps taken in the right direction, the statistics surrounding cell phone related car accidents is still far too high. There should be a national level ban of handheld use while driving in the United States.\\n\\nWhile the tragedy of cell phone related car accidents, or car accidents in general for that matter, cannot be prevented, there is more that can be done in order to combat this problem, and it is absolutely necessary that it is done. Handheld use of cellphones should not be legal in the United States, for the safety of everyone who uses the roads, and anyone who walks alongside them.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving.\" Federal Communications Commission, 5 Apr. 2018, www. fcc. gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving.\\n\\n\"Texting & Driving.\" DMV.ORG, www. dmv. org/distracted-driving/texting-and-driving. php.

       " \"No Cellphones While Driving\\n\\nI think cell phones should be banned while driving. The use of cellphones while driving can cause many accidents. Most states already have a law that prohibits the use of cellphones while driving. Car accidents are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers. Another reason they should be banned is because of the rise in ones insurance.\\n\\nMany beginning drivers are the ones who are most likely to text and drive. They feel like they are free and feel they look cool with their phones out while behind the wheel. Not only teenagers, but anyone can be talking on the phone and get distracted and cause an accident. The use of cellphones is the leading cause of many accidents.\\n\\nDue to the high rate of accidents, insurance is very expensive. Insurance is extremely high for teenagers because they are the ones who tend to cause more accidents. Personally, I have almost hit many cars because I was distracted by a text message or a phone call. Since the economy and world is very different now, money is very tight. Let's face it, nobody wants to pay a high amount or even pay with their life just to check one message.\\n\\nNot only do you have to watch for cars, but for pedestrians as well. If you are in a crowded area, or somewhere near many sidewalks, avoid your phone. Anyone can be crossing the road at anytime and since the person is not paying attention to the road, there can be a very deadly accident. Hitting a pedestrian is probably the worst thing you could do. There are now new apps on cell phones that will let others know you are on the road.\\n\\nTherefore, do not text and drive. Being distracted on your phone can cause many accidents. You can hit a car, make others crash, or even worse, hit a pedestrian while they're crossing the road. Cell phones should be banned when driving.              \",\n",
       " \"Using a cell phone while driving is a big mistake!\\n\\nJust imagine that one is driving to work to rush during hour traffic and one notices that there is a backlog of cars approaching the exit. Two cars and a police car are positioned near the exit. It looks like an accident occur and one can assume that the use of a cell-phone probably was involved. Sadly enough, most of the accidents today can be attributed to the use of cell-phones as the root cause. Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents that could be avoided.\\n\\nTo begin, some people have a tendency to engage in behaviors that are not good- smoking, swimming in shark infested waters, drugs eating excessively- and using a cell-phone while driving is also one of those behaviors. Cell-phones should not be used while driving because even a two-second distraction increases the risk of crashing. Even though it has been noted that drivers who use a cell-phone drive an average of two miles slower, there is still a risk crashing due to being distracted.\\n\\nAlso, driving while using a cell-phone can be compared to drunk driving because in both cases, a person does not have enough focus to carry out a task. However, distracted driving is harder to prove and report compared to drunk driving. Tools like a breathalyzer and simple walking tests allow officers to determine if someone has been drinking.\\n\\nEven though everyone can agree that using a cell-phone while driving is dangerous, one of the major reasons that people use cell-phones is so that they don't get bored while driving and many people get to keep in touch with friends and family while driving.\\n\\nFinally, someone who is stupid enough to text and drive increases their risk of dying by 100 percent. That statistic alone should make one not use a cell-phone while operating a vehicle. There is no question that talking on a cell-phone while driving is a dangerous distraction and more penalties are needed to raise awareness about this dangerous behavior.      \",\n",

       " 'Distracted Driving:\\n\\n\"The use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle\"\\n\\nFrom teenagers to senior citizens, the majority of people own a cell phone. People are constantly on the go and life can be busy. Technology has produced many opportunities for people to stay in contact and take care of business all at the same time. Social media occupies people for many hours of the day. The cell phone has become an obsession in everyday life. As demanding as society and life in general is, and people constantly on the go, the use of cell phones while driving can cause accidents and even be fatal.\\n\\nThere are many people each day who rely on cell phones and communication each day for their jobs. Occupations such as lawn service, heating and air conditioning, electricians, and technical repairmen all depend on communication while driving an automobile. Getting in touch with people while being on the go is an unfortunate hazard in many occupations. While there are still ways to communicate and not be driving, people still live a hectic lifestyle. Although work and driving may be part of daily routine, social media is not.\\n\\nSocial media has stormed the world in the past decade. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many other social media campaigns have occupied people all ages. Access of social media through cellular devices is common among people of all ages. Everyone wants to know what is going on with their friends and family all the time. Even while they are operating a motor vehicle. This can be the epitome of distracted driving.\\n\\nDistracted driving kills and injures many people every day. Operating a cellular device can cause you to have to take your eyes of the road. When you take your eyes off the road you lose sense of control and can possibly drift into oncoming traffic. When you use cellular devices you have to take your hands off of the steering wheel. This can cause you to lose control and possibly leave the roadway altogether. Operating a cellular device above all makes you take your mind off of what you are doing, driving a car.\\n\\nThe use of cell phones while operating a motor vehicle is not the most intelligent thing a person can do. Anytime you are distracted you can be in an accident. If you enter into oncoming traffic you can be killed or kill another person.

       " \"Mobile phone use while driving is very common. It is widely considered ver dangerous to drive while on your phone. It has been a numerous numbers of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Driver's are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.\\n\\nDriving you have to be very careful for yourself and for other drivers.

Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving. Stay off your phone while driving, it isn't safe while driving.       \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nWhile driving, drivers have to focus on the road so they can see where they are going, but if they're staring at their phones they could get into a serious accident. When teens get into car accidents, it is likely due to them paying more attention to their phones then the road. Operating in-hand a cell phone while driving is against the law and there is a punishment for it. Driving in a crowded area while on your phone can lead to a car crash that will injure a lot of people. Many pedestrians die due to getting hit by distracted drivers who are on their phones. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they can injure themselves and others.\\n\\nUsing a hand-held mobile device while driving is illegal. When driving or riding a vehicle, you should not use or be distracted by your mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone when driving you risk prosecution for not having total control of your vehicle. The hands-free law is when a driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone while driving. Drivers should know this law when they get their driver's license. The hands free law is there for a reason and that reason is to keep people safe.\\n\\nBreaking the hands free law has serious consequences, you have to pay a fine and get your license suspended or taken. The fine for a first conviction is\\n\\n$50.00 and 1 point assesed against the driver's license. The fine is $100.00 and 2 points for a second conviction, and $150.00 and 3 points for three or more convictions. The more points you get on your license for breaking the hands free law your license will be taken away. In Georgia, the driver's points will stay on for 2 years; however, that is based on 2 years from the date the points are added to your driving record/history. If caught breaking this law you'll be paying a lot of money and losing your driver's license.\\n\\nDriving without paying attention to the road is very dangerous that it can cause harm to the driver and the people around it. Driver's should know that they can't have any hand-held mobile devices while driving because they are risking their own life. The hand free law is a serious law and it's there to keep the drivers safe. The punishment are serious when the hands free law is broken. Drivers can get their license taken if they get caught more than once on their phone while driving. If a driver is looking at their phones and hits a pedestrian and the pedestrian dies, then the driver will likely face manslaughter charges. If any drivers value their lives and others around them then they would pay attention to the road instead of their phones.   \",\n",

       " 'In the modern society, the average individual owns a cell phone. Millions of people everyday use their cellphones to make calls, send texts and emails, and check social media. Not everyone, however, know how to control their urge to check his or her notifications every few seconds. When on the road, this lack of attention has made texting and driving one of the number one driving related accidents in the country.\\n\\nMost know that if he or she crashes their car, there will be repercussions. For teens, it\\'s the fear of their parents anger that stops them from texting and driving. For adults, it\\'s the thought of not being able to go to work, due to a totaled car. However, both groups face a similar enemy when it comes to texting a driving, the insurance. Unknown by most teens, every crash that is his or her fault will cause their insurance prices to rise phenomenally. Should this happen, the driver may not be able to pay for the insurance, resulting it a car that can\\'t be driven. For working teens and adults, this is not an option.\\n\\nWhen thinking about texting and driving, there is a common thought, \"It won\\'t be me.\" This, however, can easily turn into a false statement. It only takes a moment of having ones eyes off of the road for things to turn sour. While a individual is looking down at his phone, a car could pull out in front of him without him realizing it. At high speeds a crash between the two cars could be deadly. No text or social media notification is worth the loss of a human life.\\n\\nThose who text and drive will always claim that they great at multitasking, and so believe that they can easily text and drive on the road. However the brain cannot, in fact, multitask.\\n\\nInstead, the brain switches between two actions, in this case it would be between texting and looking at the road. The same happens when individuals try to work on multiple projects at one. He or she will actually be switching between documents and slowly working on each. When driving, the eyes see progress in a text-to-text conversation as well as how far he or she has traveled on the road and assume that both were done at the same time.\\n\\nNo one, be they adult or teen, should text and drive. He or she could rear end another car or run off of the road, both of which would be very costly, and possibly deadly, The brain cannot focus on both actions, and will always prioritize either texting and driving, the former of which should be very dangerous, It only takes a few seconds for things to go awry, and the driver will be the one paying for it.

Why are phones so important that we can't even put it down while there driving? So, what can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving?\\n\\nWhy are phones so important that we can't even put them down while driving? Well for one it is because social media, social media has impacted this world to where people think that they must be on it 24/7. This is getting to the point to where people are having to many wrecks and losing lives over their phones. Phones while driving is just another way to say an accident waiting to happen. So, let's try to not let our phones be a distraction while driving, its not worth the consequences.\\n\\nWhat can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving? The best way possible is to put your phone on silent mode, that way it will post pone all notifications until it is turned off. The second good way is to put it out of reach (glove box, trunk, etc.) that way you will have no tendency to grab it and look at for a distraction. We need to make the roads safe as possible. If you have something that is going to distract you then you are putting yourself in danger and most importantly other drivers around you. Lets just put them away while driving it will not kill you to leave it alone until you have reached your destination.\\n\\nI think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving.

People putting their phones on \"Do Not Disturb\" can make them 10 times safer.\\n\\nIn the manual on what to know before getting on the road, it tells you that you shouldn\\'t use your phone while operating a vehicle. There are a lot of rules to the road but this is the main one. This rule is to keep the people in society behind the wheels and others with them safe. Even though cars have seat belts and air bags just in case of an accident, most times they don\\'t help you in the best of ways.\\n\\nThere are many reasons on why phones should not be in use during driving. The main reason for this is because there are many accidents on that road that cause people to get hurt. Sometimes others along with the driver behind the wheel may get hurt right along with the driver. In this case, there might be chargers put against the driver for endangering the youth and for driving while operating a phone.\\n\\nOn the road there are pedestrians walking across the road to get to and from places.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nTo begin with, today I am going to be talking about texting & driving some people do it anyways. That is why I am going to be talking about it and try to prevent it from happening. Many people die from what they do while driving and do not come out alive. Now that they got a law where you cannot drive and have the phone in your hand if you do then you will get a ticket.\\n\\nHowever, should drivers be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Answer is no they should not be able to use one while driving. Because Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash. Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Other figures suggest that someone stupid enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.\\n\\nOne the other hand, and despite those dangers, how often do people do it? Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zen drive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. People still consider drunk driving as more dangerous than texting while driving. Yet the likelihood of an accident while using the mobile phone is six times bigger than the likelihood of DUI accidents. More than 25% of car accidents in the United States are due to texting while driving.\\n\\nTherefore, so how dangerous is texting and driving? Texting and driving is a combination that has produced numerous accidents on the road, with a frightening number resulting to fatalities. There are Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. So don't text and drive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put down the phone and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing that drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people and we lose lives every day because of careless drivers.    \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nAlmost every single person that dives a vehicle probably owns a cellphone. I feel like cellphones do cause problems with some people but not all. Cellphones should be able to be used but to a certain extent. But cellphones should not be taken away because stupid people want to txt while driving. But cellphones should be allowed at red light or other as such when it is safe to do so.\\n\\nAlthough many have wrecked maybe because of a cellphone, the bad people are still going to use their phone regardless. So we should allow the ones that drive safely and follow the law to be able to use their cell phones but only to a certain extent. There might be a time where the driver needs to reach their phone for an emergency. Cell phones also might have to be used as a GPS for some drivers. Cell phones don't have to be dangerous unless you make them dangerous as a driver.\\n\\nNow cellphones are completely prohibited to drivers in Georgia. But I feel as if people are still going to get on their phones no matter the law. So I believe that we should allow the ones who follow the law to use their cellphone's to a certain extent. Anyway a worse problems then cellphones would be driving under the influence, but that's another topic. The good drivers should be rewarded for following the law and driving safely.\\n\\nAnyways cellphones could be a problem just depending on when and how you use them while driving. Regardless of the law the ones who want to text and drive will do that. But the law followers will only use the phone when it is safe to do so. In long car rides people might need to contact someone. So cellphones don't always have to be a problem unless you are taking advantage and not being safe with it.\\n\\nTo all the ones who still text and drive and constantly use their cellphone while driving are wrong. But the people who follow the law should get the privilege of using it at certain times while driving. For example, maybe at a red light or maybe to make a phone call when not many cars are around the road. But the ones who don't follow the law are making cell phone use while driving a terrible thing because of them abusing the use of their phone while driving. But there is safe ways to use your phone while driving, as I just stated the good should be privileged because they will follow the law of driving regardless and the bad ones will keep doing wrong.\\n\\nLast Name 2            \",\n",
       " \"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.\\n\\nThe first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.\\n\\nAlthough using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.\\n\\nIn addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This change is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.      \",\n",

Likewise, individuals without their cell phone feel sheltered because they can drive utilizing two hands. Also, they use contentions that cellphones are fundamental in crisis circumstances.

Several people demonstrate that utilizing headphones can be as perilous as holding a telephone on the grounds that the discussions diverts drivers from concentrating out and about. Researchers had demonstrated that individuals talking via telephone picture the person who they're conversing with and that doesn't meddle with driving. The issue is the point at which a vehicle swerves surprisingly or walker venture into traffic, and the mind does not have the preparing capacity to respond in time. So the issue isn't in holding the haggle telephone in the meantime what may cause a mishap on account of a needed maneuver, it is a result of discussion and absence of response at the critical moment.\\n\\nAdversaries state that PDAs are great since they have a chance to make a comeback if there should arise an occurrence of crisis.

       " 'Cell Phone Use While Driving\\n\\nCell phones have grown into a significant part of people\\'s day-to-day lives. Phones are primarily hand-held, which when used while driving is the cause of both minor and major road accidents. Given the importance of cell phones in people\\'s lives, it is not practical to completely ban their use, but it makes more sense to identify safer ways to use the cellphone while driving. Numerous technologies have been developed with the purpose to make driving while using cell phones much safer like virtual assistance, speech-to-text software, and Bluetooth headsets. Practicality dictates that rules and regulations have to be designed to address hands-free cell phone. These laws will encourage safe practices, especially where fines and jail times are the consequence of breaching said laws (White, Eiser, and Harris 323). Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free, at appropriate times, and by the law.\\n\\nThe use of cell phones, either hand-held or hands-free, causes distractions and is dangerous to the people in the car and pedestrians. Drivers are encouraged to avoid all use of their mobile devices while on the road to ensure they are focused on driving. Nonetheless, altogether banning the use of cell phones is not helpful since phones have become a part of life. Therefore, it makes sense to identify safer ways to use cell phones while driving that do not endanger people (White, Eiser, and Harris 330). A study conducted by researchers concluded that the use of hands-free cell phone tech minimizes the time spent on the manual tasks in cell phones, particularly when compared to hand-held cell phones. Also, despite these facts, drivers are still likely to use handheld phones even though there is a safer alternative (Soccolich et al. 26).\\n\\nThe most effective hands-free device is the Bluetooth headset, which helps the driver answer the phone without handling it or fiddling with dials. The driver has to use the headset to both speak and listen. Furthermore, voice activation should be enabled to eliminate the need to touch the phone buttons completely. One of the best strategies, when a driver has to talk to someone, is to park the car, make the call, and switch to the Bluetooth headset, which eliminates the need to touch any controls when driving. Also, drivers can use virtual assistant software to make calls such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant (Hoy 82). When it comes to texting while driving, drivers are advised not to since it distracts from the task and can cause fatal accidents. Luckily, there are speech-to-text technologies on most smartphones that eliminate the need to hold one\\'s phone while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, any distractions are a hazard to safe driving, including the use of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. An appropriate solution is to identify ways in which drivers can drive while using their cellphones without unnecessarily endangering themselves or other pedestrians. Consequently, laws have to focus more on better ways to allow the use of mobile phones rather than altogether banning the use of phones while driving. Cell phones have become a significant part of people\\'s day-to-day lives. All things revolves around staying connected via these devices. Therefore, drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free and at appropriate times.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nHoy, Matthew B. \"Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and more: An introduction to voice assistants.\" Medical reference services quarterly 37.1 (2018): 81-88.\\n\\nSoccolich, Susan A., et al. \"Comparing handheld and hands-free cell phone usage behaviors while driving.\" Traffic injury prevention 15. sup1 (2014): S21-S26.\\n\\nWhite, Mathew P., J.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nDriving is the most used form of transportation worldwide, it is everyone's personal transportation to go anywhere. Even though automobiles are used on the daily, car accidents occur every day in the U.S, there is about 3,287 deaths a day due to a car accident and yearly there are around 2 million people are in a car accidents. Humans are on their phones every day either talking on the phone, texting, or on social media. On average people use their phone for over 5 hours a day. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Phones should not be used while driving.\\n\\nDriving is a big responsibility that some people don't necessarily take seriously, which is why people text and drive which has been the cause for a lot of accidents. On average the age people are texting and driving is between 18 and 34, which is also the age group where people get into a car accident. About 35% of teenagers get into an accident because they were using their phones while driving. Driving and texting is a bad combination and should be banned in all states just for safety reasons.\\n\\nAlthough texting and driving is not the safest way of driving, it does have a positive effect when driving. For example, if you're in another state trying to figure out where you are going, then it is acceptable to use your phone for directions. Phone companies and care companies are making it safer to drive while on the phone because they added Bluetooth to the cars to make it easier to talk on the phone without having to grab their phone. Although these are positive attributes, the negative attributes dealing with texting and driving involve car accidents and sometimes even death. This could be avoided if phones usage while driving is banned.\\n\\nPhone usage while driving is way too distracting, especially for those who already drive recklessly. There are allot of younger people who like to drive fast and recklessly because they want to feel that rush of speeding on the highway and passing an abundance of cars. What makes that situation much worst is, the younger new drivers will drive really fast and will be on their phone trying to text their friends or on social media. This is how car accidents are caused and how deaths occur with those accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving is a big responsibility and something people should take more serious, especially if they have passengers in the car. When you're driving with passengers, their safety and the driver's safety is very important. So their priority should be the people in the car and others on the road, not their phone and who texted them or who liked what on social media. Think about it like this, social media will always be there when you're here or not, so is getting on your phone while driving worth the risk of losing your life or taking someone else's life?                  \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving.\\n\\nMajority of people have phones and have a vehicle that they use dailey. Should people use their phones while operating a vehicle? The answer is no people should not be able to use phones during operating a vehicle. Using phones while operating a vehicle is dangerous. The phone distracts people from doing what they need to do.\\n\\nPhones are technology that people use for everything. Phones can engage a person on a high level scale to where people a lot of times don't even know what they are doing. Phones carry a lot of things for people to use like apps, social media, and face timing. All of these things on the phone distract the person using it and they are just stuck in the virtual world and they barley enjoy the real world because they are in their phones too much. These points are valid because people will use their phones while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nUsing phones while operating a vehicle is very dangerous for the persons safety and others. Using a phone while operating a vehicle is already illegal so that's also a main reason not to use the phone while driving a vehicle. People can not use phones during operating a vehicle because they will be too distracted and they will not pay attention to the road or area they are going to. People should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle it puts other people in danger and you do not want to be hit or do the hitting.\\n\\nPeople will suffer if they use their phones while operating. Say for an example you are on your phone while driving and u hit a person with your car the first thing the cops are going to ask you, is what where you doing. And you would say i was on my phone and you would go to jail and for a long time because it's illegal to use your phone while driving. While all that is happening your going to be thinking and regretting that you pulled out your phone while driving and if you killed the person then you would probably be in jail for life and no one wants that. So people should not be able to use their phones while driving.\\n\\nNo one should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. It's illegal already you don't need any more trouble because bad consequences will happen. It's dangerous for the driver and the people around.\\n\\nThe phone distracts very hard to the point where the person using it doesn't pay attention in the real world. People should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle.       \",\n",
       " 'Using a Phone While Driving\\n\\nIn the United States the number one leading cause of car accidents are caused by distracted drivers who are on their cell phones. Texting while driving has caused over 3,000 teen traffic fatalities a year. When driving it is very easy to get distracted by devices such as phones, even those who think they are more experienced get into car accidents because of texting while driving.\\n\\nSociety nowadays is more dependent on their devices due to the inconvenience of not knowing what is going on in their daily life. Not to mention the development of technology has been implemented on the teens of the 21st century, causing more people to find social connections through devices rather than interactions. The concern has become a negative impact to the point people are placing a person\\'s well being, in the same comparison to one of a broken phone. The effect a device has is also impacting the mental well being of the youth, in a recent study found between the years of 2010-2015 the suicide rate on females rose to 65% while the depression rate rose by 58%. This addiction to phones has also been carried out into areas such as in cars.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. The concern about using phones while driving impacts the lives of not only themselves but also puts the lives of others at risk. Cars have become more developed over the ages to cater the needs of those who need to call by installing a bluetooth, so drivers will not open and check their phone while driving. In the past driving was in the concern of \"keeping your eye on the road\" but as time went by so did the sensibility of driving.\\n\\nPhones have now become a priority even when on the road and the lack of common sense is lacking more and more over time.\\n\\nWhatever reason, people have become more adapted to checking their phones while driving, thinking that 3 seconds of simply \"checking\" ,wouldn\\'t change anything. The awareness of people driving and texting or using their phones is not impacting enough to the public. Teens are learning these bad habits and becoming accustomed to do such actions without thinking of the consequences. Thinking of how society is progressing, situations like teen accidents will not change unless the awareness of it is made more serious. In some states\\' they are taking the first actions to prevent accidents by adding in laws that prohibit phones to be in a driver\\'s hand. There is nothing more serious than being able to impact someone\\'s life by taking a brief moment to check your phone while on being in the driver seat.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving is a serious matter that should be taken seriously and not as a joke. There is no greater good than taking the moment to concentrate on what is in front of you rather than what is next to you. Take caution in driving and keep both hands on the wheel to prevent anymore suffering and any harmful casualties from devices.\\n\\n\"Cell Phones.\" Teen Driver Source, www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones.\\n\\n\"11 Facts about Teen Driving.\" DoSomething. org, www. dosomething. org/us/facts/11-facts-about-teen-driving.\\n\\n1            ',\n",

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nPhones have been around for quite a while now. Half of the population uses their phones while driving. People use their phones 90% of the day to talk, text, and, answer phones calls while their behind the wheel. There are some people that knows how to use their phones and drive and then it's the ones who can't focus on the road and text. 75% of the time cell phone usage behind the wheel is used because it's an important call from the office or family emergency.\\n\\nPhones was introduced in 1980 and the usage of phones have sky rocket over the last two decades. It's mostly teens who use the phone and then you have some adults who use their phone just as much as teens. Teen's use their phones so much that when they get behind the wheel they forget that you can't text and drive over 4000 driving accidents happen because somebody was texting and driving. These accidents happened because they wouldn't pay attention to the road because that text was so important to them and now somebody has either died or ended up in the hospital because of them. Each year a child under the age of 18 has died because of a car accident because of texting and driving.\\n\\n90% of the day somebody is driving with their phones in their hands. When you drive your main focus should be on the road and not on your cell phone. Phones are like addictions because if you haven't had your phone in your hand all day you feel lost which isn't good. If you can't take 10 minutes out the day to pay attention to the road when you get behind the wheel then you shouldn't be driving. When someone is on their phone while driving they claim they were on checking and email or answering a call and sometimes that isn't true they were texting and driving and not paying attention to the road.\\n\\nThere are some people out here that thinks they know how to text and drive like pro. I don't think they should be touching a wheel because having that mentality could get someone killed because they want to drive reckless. Driving while on your phones should really stop because everybody deserves to make it home to their family at the end of the day. Over these last four years phones and driving has cause a lot of deaths to the youth and it's mainly teens who do the texting and driving but some adults should take some responsibly because they do it too or they learn from so if you have your kids in the car with you while your texting and driving stop because they're going to start doing what you do because they feel like they have control over the car like you do.\\n\\nSo as you can see I don't agree with phones and driving it should be taken seriously because people are out here losing their life because somebody decided to pick up their phone and see who was texting them.75% of those who text while driving make it home to their families at night most don't so put down the phone for the ones who don't make it home.\\n\\nLast Name 2                        \",\n",
       " 'The Dangers of Using your Phone and Driving\\n\\nRecently, Georgia has passed the \"Hands-Free\" law, which states that no driver can use their electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Although it is a law, many people still don\\'t obey this law. Many may think that they can multitask but it\\'s not a very good idea. Drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their devices while driving for many reasons. A few reasons are that many other lives are at risk, they can get a ticket and it can cause insurance rates to increase.\\n\\nDepending on how much experience a driver has, they might think that they can trust themselves to multi-task. One out of Four car accidents is caused by a driver who\\'s texting and driving. When a driver gets their phone out and isn\\'t really paying attention to the road, they don\\'t realize that they\\'re putting everyone\\'s lives in that car and many lives out on the road at risk. Car accidents can happen at any time and drivers should at least try to prevent them from happening. No driver should want to be responsible for an accident that takes their or other lives away or pays the price for their actions.\\n\\nSome people may think that they can\\'t get caught so they continue to do it. Of course, if you disobey the law there will be consequences. For texting, while driving, the fine can be up to\\n\\n$150 and up to a total of one point on the driver\\'s license. To some people, the fine isn\\'t a problem, but getting points on a license are way worse and it affects everyone. Once points on a license add up, it can cause suspension of the license.\\n\\nAfter those consequences, now the insurance company gets involved. When they find out that their client gets a ticket for texting and driving, they will most likely increase the insurance rate. Depending on the insurance company, they will think it\\'s better to just cancel the policy.\\n\\nEveryone\\'s safety is important on the road. No one should risk their life or anyone\\'s life just to send a text or check how many likes their post got. If a phone call or text message is an emergency, drivers should pull over before answering. Personally, checking it really isn\\'t worth it because you never know what can happen on the road especially when so many people seem to be unfocused and or rushed.         ',\n",
       " 'Keep Your Eyes On the Road\\n\\nA cell phone and a car, two random inanimate objects people use today for more \"convenient purposes\". They both allow us to have all the freedom in the world for us to do whatever we want. But what happens when you take the distraction from the usage of a cell phone and try applying it into driving? To say the least, a number of catastrophic possibilities could happen if we decided to take our eyes off the road. You could get pulled over and get a slap on the wrist by paying a fine while adding points to your license in the process, or get involved in a serious accident that could result in getting yourself hurt or killed while potentially doing the same to the person you hit. Either way, even a second of your attention to your phone could cost you your driver\\'s reputation, or your life...and I should know since I myself was a victim of an incident such as this. Your life shouldn\\'t be at risk because you chose to take your eyes off the road to check a text.\\n\\nThis incident happened roughly four years during the summer. I went to go get cakes for my mom and my sister for their birthday party. My friend, my brother and I decided to go get the cakes for my mom and sister from Walmart. I got the cakes as well as a few extra snacks for myself within ten minutes. It was relatively dark outside when we were driving home. Also, it didn\\'t seem like we were going the right direction home. With that in mind, my friend decided he was going to make a u-turn somewhere and go back where we started and go home. Everything was going fine, until there was a mid sized pick-up truck cane at us at about 20 mph with a distracted driver behind the wheel. The lady that was on her phone and ended up running a stop sign while on the phone as my friend was finishing a u-turn. She hit the passenger side of my friend\\'s car. I was in the passenger seat, and my brother was in the seat behind me and luckily, no one was seriously hurt. The most my friend and my brother suffered through was sore bones, and minor injuries. While I on the other hand, suffered a minor concussion, bleeding from the side of my head, and short term memory loss. We were all lucky to have a seatbelt on because if we didn\\'t, things would have turned out way worse and I might not have been able to walk away from that situation.\\n\\nYour life shouldn\\'t be at risk because you took your eyes off the road to check a text.\\n\\nAlthough driving can be relaxing and/ or fun, it can also be equally as dangerous. Getting involved in an accident while not having your seatbelt on is risky enough already. But texting and driving on the other hand, could not only get yourself hurt or killed, but the person you hit with your car as well. If you\\'re going to use your phone while on the road purposefully, make sure you don\\'t make your phone your main focus. Or, if you feel like you are going to use your phone purposefully, be sure to turn it off and keep it away. Because one way or another, life is inevitable, and you\\'ll never know when death will come knocking at the door.   ',\n",
       " '\" Phones & Driving \"\\n\\nHave you ever really asked yourself how bad or life-threatening, texting while driving actually is? What about; actually analyzing whether it should/or shouldn\\'t be legal or illegal for people to use their phones while driving? If you haven\\'t already, let\\'s take this time to thoroughly examine and /or analyze this controversial topic. Some people argue that texting while driving should be allowed because; they most likely haven\\'t yet been in an accident while they were texting and driving. Others argue that it shouldn\\'t be allowed for the sole reason that it is: deadly, life-threatening and scary.\\n\\nImagine being in (a) / your car doing your daily task; driving/ or going to school, work, or to run errands and suddenly you get hit from the back, the front, or the side by another car, who hit you because they were irresponsible enough to be on their phones while they were driving... traumatizing experience to even think about right? I don\\'t know about you, but most people would agree with the most logical decision that would not only benefit but also insure our safety a little more. Research made; shows various reports that claim that, this year there has been close to \\'4,000 deaths\\' due to the distracted drivers. That\\'s a crazy number don\\'t you think? It\\'s actually even been higher than that at one point. Pretty sad, I know.\\n\\nNow, put yourself in the opposite position; you\\'re the driver who so irresponsibly and recklessly is using their phone while driving... you\\'re thinking it\\'s no big deal to check your phone for a \"quick minute\" \\'while the light\\'s on red\\' or you\\'re at a \"driving stopping point\". Then comes the part where the car in front of you, brakes and since you\\'re too busy on your phone you don\\'t notice and continue driving hitting the car in front of you, causing impact to both cars. This one reckless mistake can make you cause not only your life but someone else\\'s. That one careless decision can either take your life or make you continue living a life with regrets, sadness, and trammua. Most people wouldn\\'t bear such experience.\\n\\nI know what you\\'re thinking now; you\\'re probably saying something to yourself like:\\n\\n\"ugh. I\\'ve heard that many times but it hasn\\'t happened to me, because I\\'m not that reckless and I pay good attention\" but, how would you feel knowing that the odds aren\\'t that low??? The odds of an accident happening due to using your phone while driving are insanely high, majority of the people would consider minimizing those chances by simply not using phones while driving, for the SAKE of your life, and our lives! If making it illegal to use or phones\\' while driving, is what it takes to keep us safe on the road and would also minimize the death rates due to \\'phones and driving\\', then so be it, right?\\n\\nWe all want to live a longer and healthier life, so we can all agree that keeping/ or making the usage of our phones while driving illegal, is the best choice. In life there are only so many things we can do to prevent our deaths, that if we have the opportunity /or the solution, then we should take it and act upon it. You can always use your phone just wait those 30 minutes or however long it\\'s going to take you because that phone and those messages, videos etc., will always be there but you can\\'t bring a life back, you can\\'t take that one mistake back, you can\\'t fix things but you prevent these things. So...\\'stay off the phone and just look at the road\\'!!!      ',\n",

An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while texting, including use of cell phones while driving, resulting in injury and occasionally death. Know the facts, be involved, and keep the roads safe.\\n\\nTexting while driving is the act of using a cellphone while behind the wheel of a vehicle. This includes talking or texting on your phone, playing mobile games, using apps, pulling up a map; anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. Using a cell phone while driving drastically increases the chances for serious accidents on the road. However, everyone can help in the cause to prevent injuries by ending texting and driving.\\n\\nThe first thing that can be done is to give clear instructions to new drivers. Give easy and simple instructions so they can understand. Before drivers get their licenses, tell them that diverting their eyes from the road for a few seconds could cause serious injury to someone. Leading by example is another action we can take to make the roads safer. No one should text and drive, so show others that by not doing it. If you\\'re an example for others, they\\'ll likely follow. Set some rules for yourself to follow and enforce them on your family.\\n\\nTexting while driving is not a very responsible or smart thing to do. It can be very serious and lead to harm. Thousands of people every year are seriously injured due to texting behind the wheel. However, we can prevent it from happening, if we set rules for family, lead by example, and teach others we can help stop texting while driving.

It has come to the point where Georgia has adopted a new law to make cell phone use out of your hands literally. The law makes it illegal to have a cellphone in your hand, hence the name hands-free. However the number of people still using their phones is pretty high. According to an article by AJC titled, \"Georgia\\'s distracted driving law turns 1: Has anything changed?\" The State Patrol gave 22,327 distracted driving citations from July 1- May 31. It is still pretty soon to tell if the law has been a complete success but in its first year the number of fatalities in Georgia has dropped 2.2%. Just proving if people leave their phone alone while driving it would save the lives of all people in a car.\\n\\nOn the other hand, many people believe that their phones are needed while they drive. They could come to great use in some occasions like using it for GPS or calling for an emergency. Thus making the point to keep cell phones, but this does not eliminate the consequences the phones causes. There are more consequences towards using your phone while driving than there are benefits. Car crashes and accidents tend to happen more often when there is a phone involved, even if you are using it to find your way around.\\n\\nAlthough there might be a few benefits to using your phone while conducting a vehicle, they should not be allowed while driving. Cell phones can have a detrimental effect on someone if they are used when in the driver\\'s seat. The usage of a phone while driving can lead to accidents, citations, and the end of someone\\'s life.\\n\\nTellez 2            ',\n",

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. The yearly car accidents that happen every year is 1.6 million cars a year.\\n\\nNot only does texting and driving puts your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers.\\n\\nUsing your cell phone while driving dramatically slows down your reaction time. Shown in a study texting while driving delays reaction times by 37%, while drinking to the legal limit delays reaction times by 13%. Making driving with a cell phone more dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol.\\n\\nIn conclusion driving with a cell phone is a really bad idea it increases the chance of you crashing, putting others around you in danger and slows your reaction time.

Throughout the recent years and the invention of \"the smartphone people\" utilized the technology to keep in contact with family and other people around the world. But during this time people would get carless and use their phone while driving. This is called \"Texting and Driving\", a word that is collaborated with \"Drinking and Driving\" where people would be under the use of alcohol while operating a vehicle, but texting and driving is applied that the driver is using their phone while driving causing the driver to be distracted from keeping their eyes on the road.\\n\\nTexting and Driving is a serious problem in the U.S and can cause multiple problems for the driver and other drivers on the road. Heres one case According to the source (https://www. cbsnews. com/news/new-jersey-woman-faces-10-years-in-prison-for-deadly-texting-while-driving-case-2019-11-26/)\\n\\n\"A New Jersey woman is facing up to a decade in prison after being convicted in a groundbreaking case.

       " \"Phones and Driving Essay\\n\\nThere are two items people in the world can't wait to get. A car and a phone. Both are very much needed on today's day and age. A car to get you to where you need to go, and, a phone to contact people. But let me say this, they both DO NOT go well together.\\n\\nMy first reason for why people should not be able to use their phones while they drive is that it is dangerous. You are driving a metal box going 60+ miles down the road. There's nothing to stop you from turning slightly to the right and hitting a two-ton semi-truck or going to the left and coming into oncoming traffic. You need to keep 100% attention to the road just in case some maniac does decide to do that or if someone slams on brakes in front of you. Using your phone while driving takes some of that attention off from the road which is dangerous to yourself and other drivers around you.\\n\\nNow what are the benefits of texting and driving? Texting someone back? Posting a snapchat on time? The dangers of texting and driving far outweigh the benefits. Now the most leading cause of death for teenage drivers is texting and driving according to www. integrityinsurance. com. That text or that snap can wait till you get home.\\n\\nMy final reason for why you shouldn't text, and drive is that it is illegal. If all the reasons I explained earlier could not get you to stop then maybe this will. If you are seen texting and driving by a police officer, you can get in various amounts of trouble according to which state you are in. In some states it is a fine that ranges from 50-500$. In other states it can result in criminal misdemeanor charges or and evil jail time.\\n\\nNow that you have heard my reasons for how texting and driving is dangerous and even deadly, you too need to take a stand. Tell a friend or family member that you know texts and drives that they need to stop. Now.   \",\n",
       " \"I strongly believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices while operating a vehicle. For one it causes accidents, secondly it could cause them trouble and create problems on their end, and last but not least it's a Georgia rule. There's almost one thousand accidents every day due to driving while being on a cellular phone, in fact that's how a lot of people lose their close ones. These are my reasons on why I feel that drivers should not be able to use any type of device while operating a mobile vehicle.\\n\\nYou could be having one of the best days in your life, and all it takes is one look down and that could be your life right at that moment. Texting and driving has one of the highest death rates any one has ever seen. Think about whom ever else life your putting in danger just by looking down at your phone. It may cause you to react, then once you react to the situation it may cause somebody else to panic, and just like that everything's out of place. Honestly you would strongly regret the problem that you could cause so let's put the phones down.\\n\\nPlaying with a mobile device could truly hurt you at your own sakes. Imagine driving down the freeway, and then you end up in a ditch. Maybe even just running into somebody in a head on collision all because you look down for a hot second. Next the cops would have to get involved, your family would be hurt, or even the family of the victim. This could create problems for yourself. It could create something so big you wouldn't even want to drive anymore, or maybe even make you paranoid. Keeping the phones away saves a life every day.\\n\\nLast be not least texting while driving is an officially a state law. You don't want to cause problems for yourself just because you wanted to text you friend back. I'm pretty sure your dreams and ambitions are way more important that sitting behind bars because of a stupid text message. It wouldn't even be necessary, to have to pay a large few for a ticket, or even have to attend court when you could just have put it down until you got to your destination. So let's obey the laws and do what's right.\\n\\nIn conclusion I know that we have talked about, the trouble cellular devices can cause. It's something that I feel we just shouldn't be allowed to have when driving, it causes consequences and way too much other commotion. Think about not only your safety but others before you make a call or shoot a text. It all lies on you and the decisions you make, just rely on the right ones to keep you from tickets, and trouble. But these are my reasons on why I feel that it is not an good idea and should not be allowed.                   \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving.\\n\\nIt's not always easy to control a vehicle. Weather conditions, traffic, and other people make driving very difficult sometimes. If you add the distraction of a cell phone, driving is 10 times more difficult to focus on. You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.\\n\\nAnother important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car. When someone rides in your vehicle, whether its a friend or your child, you are responsible for them. By using your phone at the wheel, you put both you and your passengers at risk of injury or even death. You also put the strangers driving beside you at risk. Texting and driving doesn't just risk you. Most fatal car crashes involve more than one car. If you don't want to live with the fact that you hurt someone you love or even just a stranger, using your phone while driving shouldn't be an option.\\n\\nLastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money. In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket. With each offense, the fines get larger. It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive. Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.\\n\\n3            \",\n",
       " \"Should or Shouldn't drivers use devices while operating a vehicle? I think drivers shouldnt use any device while operating a vehicle. The reason being is because you can put yourself and others in serious danger. You using a device when you should be paying attention to the road can cost so much damage to things and others. No person should use no device especially if they have a child on board during driving time. You wouldn't want to hurt your child due to this dangerous thing to do. This type of thing had cost many car accidents which is likely 45% to happen of most accidents made because of the use of devices.\\n\\nIf you want to be able to use any device while driving , I think you should get something that's safer to use during your time of driving. Having a phone holder so that you wouldn't have to take your eyes off the road at any given moment . It's safe to use because you can still manage your driving and what you are trying to do on your device at the same time. You can still make phone calls and such things of that nature. A little more in depth on why this is still a dangerous thing to do. Many people that drives like teens the ages like 17 and older attend to use devices while toxicated or other things pertaining to that. This is more dangerous to use a device because you are unaware of everything going around you.\\n\\nThis is why most teens or adults have many accidents because of driving using a device while driving. While learning to drive there were no things saying to use a device while driving. You don't think about other lives while doing these dangerous things? To me I don't think so because therefore no accidents wouldn't be made because of this type of thing. I think if people did care everyone wouldn't use a device at all unless it's a safe device to use which is a blue tooth device. People need to follow rules more so that these things can be avoided. When you follow rules they stop a lot of things from preventing car accidents.\\n\\nI think people who use a device while driving and they cost a accident should have a serious consequence. They know on the road no device shouldn't be used because of what can happen to yourself and others around you. So when it happens they should get the full consequence that is because these things need to stop because people want to do things at the wrong given time. So this what should happen if the person are in the wrong.\\n\\nThis is why I think devices shouldn't be use during operating a vehicle because of all the things that can happen in my previous paragraphs. This should be put out more so that people can really abide by this so that it can and will prevent bad things from happening.                   \",\n",

Us humans are getting to the point where; all we use is technology. While we are driving, we are either on the phone with someone or either like what teens use now, there on snap recording something.\\n\\nReason 1 drives should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.\\n\\nReason 2, Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because drivers text and drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone.\\n\\nCell phones have been very popular lately in car crashes, most of the time in a car crash the reason is always because one of the people operating the vehicle are on their phone.

One particularly dangerous aspect is the operation of a motorized vehicle. Use of a telephone to any extent while driving has been prohibited in Georgia. Rightfully so, considering the overwhelming number of car accidents caused by a person using a cell phone behind the wheel. Drivers should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a motorized vehicle.\\n\\nNo human is able to multitask and do each task to the best of their ability. So why should people be allowed to do two tasks that require a vast amount of focus to complete at the same time? It is a recipe for disaster and the proof is everything from television commercials to cold, hard statistics. According to The National Safety Council, use of a cell phone while driving caused 1.6 million car crashes each year. That means 1 in 4 car accidents were caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nGeorgia has implemented a new law called The Hands Free law, stating that it is illegal to have your cell phone in your hand while driving. This has seen a tremendous decline in car accidents since the passing of this law. This only further proves that texting and driving is deadly and leads to immense amounts of casualties.\\n\\nTexting and driving should continue to be outlawed, and the hands free law should be implemented all over the country. It saves lives and decreases the amount of annual car crashes. No one should have a phone in their hand when in the driver's seat of a moving vehicle.

You should always keep your eyes on the road. Accidents can happen in a second and anyone could lose their life behind all of it just because you want to text and drive. Your safety is important and everyone else is too.\\n\\nDriving while texting causes car wrecks. You could be going down a road with no cars and suddenly you hit a tree, a light pole or even a building. Just because you're on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Someone could be running out to your car yelling for help while you're driving and suddenly you hit them. You get out your car your car is messed up and they are laying in the road unconscious.\\n\\nNot only is someone injured, but you are now responsible for trhe financial difficulties they will face in the future.\\n\\nYour phone is not more important then you're safety on the road. Your safety on the road is more important than a phone. You can always get another phone, but you can never get another life from a bad car wreck. Most car wrecks involve death. Think about your life before getting on a phone. Instead of you paying attention to the road you want to be on social media looking at things that doesn't concern you. Your car could be gone and your life. All because you want to be on your phone.\\n\\nDriving while on your phone can also cause you to pay for someone else car because you were in the wrong by being on your phone. You could be the reason why that person loses their life and end up in jail. Your freedom is more important then you are risking your life and doing time for a phone. In a movie it was this girl about 17 years old. She was getting ready to leave and her mom stopped her and told her to drive safe. While she was driving, she wasn't paying attention to the road. Out of nowhere this little boy was walking home, and she hit him. The little boy lost his life and she went to jail all behind that. His parents were depressed that he was gone. You should never pick up your phone while driving because anything could happen.\\n\\nIn all states you are not allowed to text and drive nor eat while driving because someone could get hurt. If you get pulled over by talking on the phone or texting, you automatically go to jail. 20% of drivers get pulled over just for being on their phones and not watching the road. Some officers let people off with a ticket warning. Your ticket may be about the price of 200-300 dollars. Don't risk your time in jail just because you didn't want to listen. Do what's right.\\n\\nIn conclusion texting and driving is bad. Don't text and drive at the same time. Add a little more detail here. Just because you don't see anything in your way, if you look down at your phone, you can easily have a car wreck. Someone can die just because if you want to be on your cell phone.\\n\\nYou never know what could happen while on your phone. Your life could flash before your life.

There are three types of distractions while driving and they are manual, cognitive, and visual. Manual distractions is when the drivers hands is taken off the wheel in front of them and cause them to pay more attention to text message then the steering wheel. The next one is cognitive, cognitive redirects a driver's focus onto the conversation they are in and taking your mind off driving. After that the next one is visual this is different from the two because visual is the most important if your eyes goes off the road you automatically lose focus of the road ahead.\\n\\nNow the only way to prevent all of these things from happening is to make texting while driving illegal. Drivers should not have their phone in their hand while driving it should be placed on a phone holder and phone should be connected to the car bluetooth so that everybody on the road is safe and no ones lives will be in danger. Police are cracking down on texting and driving because the generation now doesn't know how to keep their phones out of their hands. Driving is a serious matter and our attention should be given 100% while driving, this is basically the same as basically the same as drinking and driving. Many consequences can occur from texting/drinking and driving. tickets, fines, accidents, and possibly death can be caused by these unreasonable actions.\\n\\nSo please teens keep your phone away from your hands while in a vehicle or have your phone in a phone holder so that everybody on the road or in the car with you are safe and remain in great condition.            \",\n",
       " \"Cell Phone Usage\\n\\nIn our everyday life we always have a cell phone either in our hand or right next to us. In this society we have grown to use our cell phones for everything we do. It has become our everyday usage. I believe drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle as it can be distracting and cause many accidents.\\n\\nThe cause of many accidents is due to people using their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Many people think if you just look down on your phone for a second no harm will be done. Well that is not the case, all it takes is one second for your life to change. You have to think if that text is worth it and think of all the possible outcomes from just doing that. It is best to put your phone on, do not disturb and have your phone out of your sight. Not only should you think about yourself but the other people on the road. Car accidents can cause death to many people with that one second distraction. A lot of times when people do use their phone while driving it was not even worth it, so again think if it is worth the pain you can cause others.\\n\\nDriving consists of you having your eyes on the road at all times to ensure everyone is safe. Phone usage while operating a vehicle is a distraction to not just yourself but to others. Many states have laws on using your phone while driving. In Georgia it is prohibited. This can decrease the amount of car accidents that happen on the road. In fact, it has decreased the numbers in many states when they force this law in. People who are not multi taskers also can cause a lot of harm in the road for people as they can not do more than one thing at once.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why people use their cell phone while driving but the only valid reason is when they're using the gps. There are still many cars that do not have a built in gps system so it leads people to use their phones to guide them to their destination. Which still is not a good excuse. They can always listen to what the gps is saying without looking at their phone. Many people feel they need to see it visually in order to follow it. Uber drivers use their phone at all times when they're on the clock. Their whole work is operated on a phone but many usually have a phone holder if they believe they need to visually see it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving. As I explain it can lead to many accidents and distract you on what's important which is the road. You are not only harming your safety but others. So before you think about using your phone ask yourself is it worth it.\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " 'The essay i am writing i will be talking about phones and driving and how it has become such a big problem. And how common it is now days for people to be on there phones while driving and mainly texting. Even doe we have came out with hands free law people still continuously text and talk on the phone which means they are not obeying the laws even if that hands free law is out. People still do it like if they don\\'t care. That\\'s a problem because there are more accidents being caused and the death rate is increasing.\\n\\nIn my opinion i say drivers should not be allowed to use cellphones while driving. Maybe if there using the gps but other then that they shouldn\\'t pick up their phones while driving. If its an emergency call they should pull over somewhere. It\\'s not right to cause accidents because someone decided to text while driving you always gotta think who your surroundings and how it will affect them. It\\'s not right for someone else\\'s mistake to take someones life away. So no there shouldn\\'t be no permission to touch your phone while driving like ive seen before on previous signs \"it\\'s better to be unread than dead\" .\\n\\nMost death rates have gone up mostly caused by teen drivers because i see i all the time they are always talking on the phone taking pictures they just don\\'t get how it\\'s dangerous to do all that. And that in a minute you could crash or take someone else life away. In my point of view i think parents should have talks with these young teens on texting and driving and tell them not to do it because it\\'s starting to get out of control and leading to bad things it has to come to a stop. The messages will always be there, there\\'s no rush to open that message. So there has to be a couple of changes made because things aren\\'t going the way there supposed to be and thats not good because people should obey the law just like they would to any other laws.\\n\\nIn all of my opinion i really don\\'t agree with people texting it\\'s just that they made that law to protect us from using our phones because they saw the whole death rate and accidents happening and just things going wrong. Why? Because due to the use of phones police are trying to do everything to get people to stop but it seems like there still doing it like it doesn\\'t get to them. While driving you always have to be 100% focused in your driving always you can\\'t be distracted because you never know what will happen next. That\\'s why you always have to be focused to be prepared for whatever happens and be aware of what is going on while driving.\\n\\nThis is what my essay is about on how i agree with texting and driving if you put it in a way to think about how if this is something safe to do what would you think or say. I don\\'t think it would sound safe to you ethier.

In the essay I will be expressing my thoughts on using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. You will learn the statistics of how the majority of car crashes are caused by cell phones. I will discuss how cell phones can cause reckless driving. We will discuss ways to prevent ways of crashing while using your cell phone.\\n\\nThe statistics show that nearly 1.6 million crashes happen every year. Every year within those crashes 390,000 people are injured. One out of four times those crashes happen is from texting. I have a story to go along with the statistics.\\n\\nA friend of mine was driving to go to the gym. On his way to the gym his father kept calling him, but he refused to use the phone while he was driving. So his dad kept calling and he thought it must be urgent. So he picked up the phone to call him back and within the first 30 seconds he crashed. Luckily it was just a minor crash and he was alright. That just goes to show you how distracting they are.\\n\\nBesides speed, the most common reason for reckless driving is caused by cell phones, mainly texting. Driving requires your undivided attention, but when you're texting you're giving over half of your attention to your phone. Yes there is a hands free law that you can use but your phone still needs your attention to use the hands free law. It's like my friend's story he didn't pick up, but once he did he wrecked.\\n\\nYou should never be using your phone while driving. It could harm not only yourself but others too. that is why it is so important to be safe and not even think about touching your phone. All of your focus should just stay on the road.\\n\\n1            \",\n",
       " 'Are Phones a problem\\n\\nDo you think the driver of a car should be allowed to use his/her phone while driving? When it comes to being allowed to have a phone behind the wheel a lot of things must come into play before it can be considered a good idea. There are a lot more cons to something like this than there are pros but the pros should definitely be taken into consideration. The best way to figure out if it is a good idea is to know everything someone requires to drive at full capacity. What we will cover is the pros and cons of drivers being allowed to use their phones while behind the wheel.\\n\\nFirst I would like to talk about the cons of something like this being allowed. Cell phone usage while driving is common but it is really considered dangerous due to the potential of causing distracted driving and crashes. Many agree that use of cell phones while driving is pervasive. \"Drivers on a cell phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, and are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards.\"\\n\\nAs stated in the text above if drivers take their eyes off of the road it is more than likely they will have accidents.\\n\\nAs I said before there are a lot more pros to phones being allowed to be used behind the wheel. Cell phones allow users to call for immediate help when needed and cell phones allow people to have directions for when they cannot find their destinations. Many local governments provide traffic updates for people with cell phones so that they can try to avoid traffic making their trip quicker. Cell phones also allow users to immediately call the police to report suspicious actions they see while driving. With all this being taking into account there are some good things that can be achieved allowing drivers the use of their cell phones.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would say there are some benefits to being able to use cell phones while driving but the chances of an accident happening significantly increase at an alarming rate. Do I think drivers should be allowed cell phone use? I do believe they should be allowed but only when they are not at risk of putting themselves or anyone in harm\\'s way. Although studies show that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. I purpose that drivers should not be allowed to text while driving but everything else of course.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nUsing cell phones while driving has a big impact on car wrecks, I believe that cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited because they play a big part in distracting the driver.\\n\\nOne reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because when one is looking in their cell phone they usually look down and look back up but anything could happen in a split second leading to an immediate reaction without thought. According to studies and statistics \"Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving\". Meaning out of all of the accidents that happen yearly 390,000 are due to texting and driving which could easily be prevented, just wait to send that text.\\n\\nAnother reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because it takes up time, the time you\\'re using to send that one text or make that one call could be time used to get where you\\'re going. The use of a cell phone while driving is inconsiderate of other drivers, it takes up their time as well. When people use their cell phones they only think of themselves, imagine if the driver behind you were in danger and you\\'re using your phone wasting time at the green light. Most people don\\'t put themselves in other people\\'s places, yet things that you do can have an effect on another\\'s personal life. If this was you in danger would you want someone driving slow in front of you because of their cell phones that they could check when they arrive to where they are going?.\\n\\nNext, cell phones could cause anybody to do reckless driving. You could be on any social media and try to see what\\'s going on in everybody else life instead of your own. Social media could wait on you until you get home. Cell phones cause reckless driving which cause accidents that could be prevented only if you waited those seconds. You never know what someone might say about you on social media, and you could get caught up in the drama. Driving while mad isn\\'t a good mix. You could take your anger out while driving extremely fast then boom you crash.\\n\\nFurthermore, you\\'re not paying attention to your driving, and road signs. Besides the green light there are more road signs. Like what if you were on your phone and you don\\'t see the sign that signals a deaf child is alert. Then a deaf child was crossing the street, and you crash into them. This could be murder, and soon you\\'ll be there locked up rotting in jail. Somethings are meant to be considered before you pick up your phone and text while driving. Most accidents could be avoided if you wouldn\\'t be so careless about others. In a passage it stated \"Cell phones aren\\'t the reason why there are car accidents.\" This isn\\'t accurate because based on my research at least 88% of people die from car accidents.\\n\\nIn conclusion cell phones should be prohibited while driving. Most accidents can be caused by using a cell phone while driving. Think about a consequence that could come with your actions while using your cell phone, neither the less it can wait. There could be an occurring accident that could be prevented all if you would be careful and mindful of people. You should consider putting your phone on airplane mode while driving. It will make driving more easier and safer for you and the people you are surrounded by.   ',\n",
       " 'Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?\\n\\nDo you think drivers should use their phones while operating a vehicle? Do you think it is safe to be on your phone while driving? Well in this essay I will be explaining why I don\\'t think drivers shouldn\\'t operate a vehicle while driving.\\n\\nMany accidents occur when drivers get on the road and are distracted by their phones. A lot of people had their life taken away from them when people were driving and being on the phone. Too young adults, too adults we all have been guilty for being too addicted to our phone including me but it is a time and a place to be on your phone and not to be on your phone. As a young adult, I know and understand the risk of driving and being distracted by my phone. Many cases have been reported on the death of people who were texted and driving. I know sometimes you want to send out the text message to your friends or your loved one. I know you want to check your email to see if you got hired for the job you want. however, you shouldn\\'t be on your phone while trying to drive. That is highly dangerous for you and the other person who is driving in the next car.\\n\\nYou should be focused on the road, not on your phone because it can only take one look away from the road to cause a serious car accident that can do two things death or put you in a critical injury .using your phone can cause serious damage while driving because you are trying to do two things at one time. Let me explain when you\\'re driving you should be focusing on the road nothing else because you can\\'t be on be focusing on two things at the same time that\\'s is impossible. another reason is that there are some people, not all that drive crazy and that\\'s don\\'t pay attention to the other car they drive fast and don\\'t care about the other people driving. So while driving you have to focus on more than one thing and I know that people probably say that\"\\n\\nbut I have always been on my phone when I am diving all the time and I haven\\'t been in an accident\". that might be the case, however, it doesn\\'t guarantee that it will not happen. in reality, it only takes one time for something that can change your life forever. These days there is a law for that now and police are locking up people for that or giving them a ticket. But what if you were the unfortunate ones that died because the police didn\\'t catch you on your phone?\\n\\nIn conclusion, if you don\\'t want to be in jail for killing someone because you\\'re distracted then you can pull over to send that text, check your Instagram or your email. Your life and freedom are more important than the people on your phone. even if you don\\'t feel like going that then have someone else in the car with you who can drive so that you can check/reply to your text message. does it have to take you to kill someone to learn the lesson?

More than 1000 teens die each year from texting while driving, 82% of adults and teens get into car accidents from other drivers texting while driving. Huntington post reported that in 2017.

       " \"It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns. Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during next two decades. The trend of using cell phones has increased throughout the world. One of the primary reasons for the gigantic growth of cell phones is that they facilitate communication offering high levels of flexibility reaching desired person within seconds whether he/she is at office, home, or outside driving a car etc. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectively and without wastage of any time. Other main reason for the explosive growth of cell phones is the safety aspect. Cell phones make it easy to contact during emergency even during driving although using cell phone while driving is mostly dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency, listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes etc.\\n\\nThere are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating while increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers have also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.\\n\\nCell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and adjusting accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death.\\n\\nAlthough, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic.\\n\\nThe paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. Based on arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.       \",\n",
       " 'Cellphones are a part of everyone\\'s day to day life. We find out information, contact others, even kill time using these tiny little computers. It sometimes seems like we couldn\\'t survive without such an essential device, but in reality it may cause more harm than good especially if used in the wrong situations. The \"National Safety Council\" reports that there are more than 1.6 million crashes every year due to texting and driving. It has become one of the nations highest causes of death. Almost every state in America has banned it and in some eye\\'s it should be enforced more than it is. The use of your cellphone while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed or even accepted in society.\\n\\nWhile driving at the speed of 55mph if you close your eyes for even 5 seconds then you\\'ve already driven the distance of a football field. Now imagine that every time someone looks down at their phone to read or respond to a text for 5 seconds they have already endangered all the other people that were in that football field\\'s length of road. Although it may seem very minor at first to just look down for a second, it is very dangerous. Even though in some situations it may seem like it\\'s an emergency and you need to reply at that moment, it is always safer to pull over and deal with it then. Risking other people\\'s lives is not something that should be taken lightly.\\n\\nWith how updated and modern our technology is now a day\\'s, there should be absolutely no reason to text and drive. New technologies have given the ability to use your phone hands free and be able to text or call without ever looking away from the road. In Georgia there was a law implemented that requires every driver to have this hands free system set up in their car. This in return has caused many drivers to put the phone away and just use the vocal features. The hands free law has saved many people\\'s lives but there are still many phone users behind the wheel.\\n\\nTo sum this up, texting and driving is very dangerous. Putting others lives at risk or even your own just to send that couple word text is not worth it. There are many ways of avoiding this problem, like simply pulling over, or using bluetooth and letting the information be told over the air. Many people would feel safer on the roads and maybe even take in some of their surroundings and be more alert. If this was taught to young teenagers before they got their driver\\'s license then many of their crashes would have been avoided.    ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nAlmost everyone in the world owns a cell phone of some kind. We use them to communicate with others, go on the internet, access social media, take photos, and more. We use our phones everyday, but should we be using them at all times? There are some occasions when phone use is unnecessary and potentially dangerous.\\n\\nUsing a cell phone when driving is something that shouldn't be done. Using your cell phone when driving could be potentially fatal. Being on your cell phone when driving is distracting. While you're paying attention to your phone screen, you could miss a lot. You could miss a stop sign or even a person crossing the street and end up hitting someone/something. Paying attention to the road is more important than checking whatever is on your phone.\\n\\nThere have been many studies to show that cell phone use while driving is dangerous. For example, the National Safety Council stated that 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. That is a lot of accidents that could have been avoided if people would have put their phones aside and paid attention to the road. Checking your messages and social media accounts is not as important as your life. When using your phone, even if you think you're a pro at using it when driving, you are still putting your life and others lives at risk.\\n\\nWhen driving you should only be focused on the road. Looking at your phone for even a second is potentially dangerous. If you need to look at your phone that badly, then you should pull over or wait until you are at a stop sign/light. If you need to check your phone on the road for whatever reason, do it in a manner that won't be potentially harmful to yourself or others. The best way to ensure you won't get distracted by your cell phone is to put it on do not disturb. Do not disturb stops all phone calls, messages, and notifications from all apps. It takes away some of the distractions and makes you less tempted to look at your cell phone when you should be focused on the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phone use when driving should be prohibited. You should not use your cell phone when driving under any circumstance. Cell phone use when driving is a huge distraction and could put you in potentially fatal situations. Avoiding cell phone use when driving is the best thing to do. When you're driving, your main focus should be on the road. Your safety should matter more than whatever message, call, or notification you get on your phone.   \",\n",

Drivers should not use their phones while driving to any location and they are many reasons why. One of the reasons is that you have a higher risk of crashing. Another reason is that it can be a huge distraction and it can keep your eyes off the road. And the last reason is that you are mostly to be found at fault for an accident. It is illegal to text and drive in the state of Georgia.\\n\\nYou should avoid using your phone while driving at all times.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving gives you a higher chance of crashing than getting lost while driving. Everyone knows that you have to pay for insurance and no wants to pay extra money after they collided with another car. In this society, we focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can not put down our phones while we are driving. Not only do you put yourself in danger, but you put innocent people in danger too. You want to live your life to the fullest and not try to lose it early.\\n\\nUsing your phone can be a huge distraction when driving. That's why it is now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia. Drivers can no longer have phones touching any part of their body while talking through your phone. Taking eyes off the road while driving is one of the first lessons that is taught to a driver in his early driver's education.\\n\\nKeeping your eyes off the road is very dangerous and no one should be distracted while driving.\\n\\nHaving your eyes off the road to check your phone for any calls or messages can lead up to an accident and can harm people.\\n\\nIf you get into an accident and you were on your phone, you can be blamed for the cause of the accident. Not only is it illegal to use your phone while driving but you can spend time in jail for using your phone. If you get into an accident and the other driver wasn't looking where they were going or wasn't following the rules then they are the reason why you got into an accident. Many young teens get into a situation where they hit a car because they didn't look straight ahead and put their eyes down to look at their phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, phones shouldn't be used while driving. If people gave up using their phones then the number of fatalities will decrease and people will feel safe driving down the road.

Cell phones are a wonderful thing just like driving is a wonderful thing but like an open flame and gasoline, who said they should go together? Texting while driving has led to way too many deaths. While common sense should tell you not to deviate attention form the road where you're not just driving for yourself but for everyone else, people still do it even though they shouldn't.\\n\\nPeople shouldn't text and drive because deviating your attention from something serious can only end up bad. If you were hiding from Jason Voorhees, scared for your life, would you watch a YouTube video? Of course not, because you are focused on staying safe. Driving should be treated the same way because one bad decision could result in a multicar collision and someone dead.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, there is a law against a driver being on their phone because of the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. There is also a fine of $150.00 as a punishment. That's better that being a number in the 1.6 million people who die every year due to texting a driving. Or the better case would be just not being on your phone and texting in the first place. Wouldn't you agree?\\n\\nThe final way to stop these fatalities is to put your cell phone in driving mode. Newer model cars with the Bluetooth feature allow this feature to be enabled.\\n\\nThat feature blocks all notifications until you are out of the vehicle. That makes it safe for the driver by taking their mind of their phone and helps others by keeping the drivers mind focused on the road.\\n\\nThat's a true definition of safety first.\\n\\nDriving is a privilege has always been true but it matters more and more every year as more people get distracted by the newest feature on their phone. Whatever is on Instagram can't be more important than your life. As more people replace their cars for the newest car that Bluetooth feature will be widely available to more people.

Cell phones are highly addictive, and although they are beneficial for connecting to the world and finding information efficiently, they have proven to be a major distraction and huge problem for drivers. People often get into car accidents while texting. Drivers should not be allowed within arm\\'s reach of their mobile device because it can harm themselves and others on the road.\\n\\nFirst of all, according to seriousaccidents. com, \"Distracted drivers are the top cause of car accidents in the U.S. today.\" This means that texting while driving is more dangerous than being intoxicated behind the wheel. People - especially teenagers - can kill themselves and others when they text while operating a motor vehicle. If they\\'re lucky to survive the crash but they kill others, they can serve up to 20 years in prison, according to criminal-law. freeadvice. com. 20 years is a serious amount of time to serve because of a text or call.\\n\\nSecondly, many students get into car accidents due to texting. They can often collide with other students or adults and may cause an injury or death. Many people believe a text should be responded to in 10 minutes or less, so one can wait to arrive at their destination before texting again. Furthermore,, if a text is too important to ignore, a person should simply pull over so they can respond, instead of distracting themself from the road and putting others at risk.\\n\\nThus, no person should be allowed to have their phone while driving due to it posing a threat to one\\'s own health and wellbeing, as well as others\\'. People should not answer texts or phone calls while they should be focused on the road when it can be such a huge distraction many problems can occur in the short period of time it requires to answer a phone call or text.

       " 'Cell Phones are now seen as an essential item for millions of people. Throughout each day people need to use their phones for multiple reasons including, communicating with family members, answering phone calls from work, or using the GPS to drive to the nearest McDonalds. Smartphones make life simpler and even safer, but that is not always the case. Most people lack the discipline to peel away from their phone when put in situations where multitasking is not a good idea. For example, while driving the steering wheel needs all of your attention because a simple glance at your phone trying to text back your mom could cause a fatal accident. It is evident that texting while driving should be banned or at least states should be willing to put major restrictions to reduce the dangerous outcomes from using an electronic device while driving a vehicle. People should not be allowed to use their cell phones at any time while driving a vehicle because they are putting themselves at a higher risk to crash, cellsphones reduce the drivers ability to maintain focus, and phones are the leading cause of accidents in the highway.\\n\\nPeople should not be allowed to use their cellphones while driving at any time due to the fact that it increases the likelihood of a car wreck. It is true, people all over the world are super busy and never enough time to get things done so they try to multitask. This leaves them to get things done while on the road. Most Americans are addicted to their phone as well and check their phone more times then needed while driving. According to a study made last year, \"People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated.\" While this may seem crazy, something illegal such as drinking and driving is less dangerous than texting and driving but, it is a fact that cannot be ignored. Even though millions are told to not text and drive they continue to ignore the deadly warnings from participating in cellphone use while operating a vehicle yet once again making the wrong choice. Always remember that texting or using a cellphone while driving is extremely risky not only for yourself but for those in your car as well as vehicles around you.\\n\\nIn 2009, 5,474 lives were taken and 448,000 people got injured from car accidents from being distracted while driving, as stated by the government. The lives of innocent people are being taken every day because of a simple distraction. Car crashes are four times more common to take place while the driver is on their phones over any other causes. Different states have views on the laws that are being used about texting while driving. Utah has a law established stating that if a driver is texting while driving and crashes they will spend fifteen years in jail. Most people don\\'t seem to realize how careless they can be while driving a car. Talking on a cell phone is not as dangerous as texting these days. While talking on the phone, it is easier to still keep focused on the road in front of the driver. When they look at their text messages, it\\'s not possible to look in both directions at once, therefore all of their focus goes straight to the screen of the cell phone. The article \"10 Terryfying facts about texting and driving\\'\\' by Drivers Alert states, \"11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T\\'s Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it\\'s dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway.\" It\\'s hard for all drivers, especially teenagers, to put down the cell phone and put their hands on the wheel, which results in many car crashes. That means the carelessness of any driver could end their life in seconds or even worse cause the death of others. While driving, the driver\\'s main focus should never be their phone; it should be getting to their destination safely.\\n\\nTexting and driving is the leading cause of crashes on the road. Most would imagine that it would be reckless driving by intoxicated people but that is not true. As stated previously, only 11 teenagers die every day due to the use of cellphones while driving and that doesnt even include adults or other bystanders. Hence, the reason why most states and countries have declared cellphone use while driving illegal. Unfortunately, the rate of crashes caused by cell phone use has only gone down 4%. Furthermore, did you know that 1 out of 4 people die from crashes that are involved with cellular device usage. Most of you would agree that you are a good driver and that texting does not impact your driving skills, but statistics show otherwise. Imagine a scenario, where you are driving and receive a text from your mother and all you have to do is respond yes or no. Studies have shown that it takes a person at least 5 seconds to reply. If you were going 55 miles per hour that\\'s like driving half a the length of a football field. Anything could happen in those 5 seconds and this is probably the case in most crashes every single day making this one of the leading causes in the world.\\n\\nThere is no question, vehicles and cell phones both are definitely important objects in every person\\'s life. Sometimes people even use both at the same time just because they can without thinking about the consequences. Bad things will always come from cellphone usage while operating a vehicle. No matter how many laws are placed, tools made to lessen the contact between you and your phone the only actual way to not allow your phone to distract you is to put it away. It is understandable, if there is an emergency and you need to pick up the phone but, if it\\'s just a text from your mom with no urgency all you have to do is simply wait. It only takes considering the possibilities of terrible things that can happen by choosing to prioritize your safety as well as others. It is never too hard to practice using your phone less while driving, and most importantly if you have children or teens who see you on your phone while driving they might think it\\'s okay to do it as well. In that case you might not crash that day, but in the future your kids who saw you do it choose to do it as well. There are various ways and solutions to make cell phone usage close to none, use them to keep yourself safe. So, next time your phone rings, make sure to send the right message by not sending that text.   ',\n",

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nOver the years, phones have developed to be an important thing in our life. Phones are apart of our everyday lives and sometimes we think we can't live without. We are afraid that we will miss something important if we don't use our phones, we must use our phones all the time even if it means putting ours lives in danger. In this essay, I will be talking about why nobody should use their phone in any way while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nNow a days, it is very tempting to use your phone any opportunity you get. Especially if you're in a vehicle and the vehicle comes to a red light. However, under any circumstances you shouldn't touch your phones because of the many dangers it can cause. Smartphones have a lot of new features to insure nobody uses their phone behind the wheel. Iphone's have a do not disturb while driving feature that was introduced last year. The feature silences/limits phones calls and text messages and you will not see the notifications until you have reached your destination. The feature automatically turns on when your phones detects that you might be driving.\\n\\nThere are many dangers to using your phone behind the wheel. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. One of the dangers of your using your phone while driving is not being completely focused on the road. When you are not completely focused on the road, you can miss a lot of things. You can miss things like other cars turning, cars trying to enter you same lane.\\n\\nAnybody any age can be tempted to use their cellphone while driving. According to the teensdriversource. org, In 2017 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 were killed in 2,935 distraction- affected crashes. Accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. The best way to avoid using your phone while driving is texting or calling anybody that you may think may contact you and tell them that you are about to drive and will get back to them when you arrive at your destination. Connect your phone to the car Bluetooth and use the buttons on the steering wheels to change the music or radio. Also set your phone inside the glove compartment so you won't be tempted to touch your phone in anyway.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that anybody any age shouldn't be use their phone while operating any vehicle. It can cause many dangerous things. Not only to you but to others also. Always remember that everybody's life is important including yours. So the text/call can wait intill after you arrive.         \",\n",
       " 'Driving Essay\\n\\nDriving has become an everyday thing to citizens. Although many find popular to use their phones why driving. This is a bad example to children. Many people have died by getting ran over, or by car accidents. Sadly, drivers don\\'t think about that when using technology while on wheels. Some states are already putting to work a hands free law, in which drivers are not allowed to use their technology while driving.\\n\\nFirst of all, technology is affecting drivers; it is developing problems to society.\\n\\nTechnology has become an addiction that can lead to deaths. It\\'s a distraction to all drivers. It\\'s also a distraction because it can distract you from seeing the speed limit which makes you get tickets. Some phone companies have come up with some potential solutions. The Apple company has a \"Do Not Disturb While Driving\" this makes your phone block all messages and phones while you\\'re in a moving car.\\n\\nSecond of all, driving causes deaths. The first cause of death is by automobiles. Children, adults, and creatures get run over every single day. Pedestrians who ride bicycles, walk or drive motorcycles are at greater risk of getting hit or run over than people who ride cars. Most car accidents occur at night because they are more likely to fall asleep or use their phones. This is likely to happen to adults and children under the age of twenty-five.\\n\\nCorresponding, to some many deaths by car Georgia came up with the Georgia Hands Free Law also known as bill six seventy-three. It states anyone who is found or seen with a phone while driving will be stopped. Civilians can make calls and answer them by using a car cradle. This law was passed to reduce traffic crashes. After the law was passed they saw a decrees in car accidents and in deaths by mobiles.\\n\\nIn conclusion civilians should not be able to use the phone while driving. It could save a life when your being safe and not using your phone while driving. Not texting and driving can prevent many future inconvenience with the law. If you don\\'t want to get a ticket and spend time in jail you shouldn\\'t use your phone while driving. Deaths decreased when the government started to take action and changing the laws for drivers.       ',\n",
       " 'Texting and Driving\\n\\nTexting while driving is a continuous topic and a very debated one. Some people believe that texting is okay while driving but I\\'m here to argue that it\\'s not. People all over the world have died or gotten injured due to sending a short text or even looking at their phone. Not only does texting and driving put your life in danger it also puts the people around you at risk. When operating a vehicle, we always need to keep our eyes on the road.\\n\\nTexting while driving should be illegal\\n\\n\"The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\" source from EdgarSnyder. com says. However, when you\\'re operating a vehicle you should not distract yourself for harm to come your way or another\\'s. Many families; mothers, fathers, and children die due to car crashes and the leading cause is texting. Many children grow up in a home without their mother or father because of a simple text.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia, last year a girl was going down the highway playing on her phone and got into a car accident, ended up killing her friend and was sentenced to 15 years 3 years in prison and 12 years of probation for murder. There are many consequences from texting and driving, I can either be as small as a ticket or as far as death and prison time. The death over texting while has increased over the years. Mothers and fathers should not be burying their children.\\n\\nHowever, some people will try to debate that they need their phone, or it was important, and it very may well have been, but if it wasn\\'t an emergency then there is no reason to be on their phone. Everybody has the choice to pull over if they want to be on the phone. Quick example, most people can\\'t even walk and chew gum and think that they can drive and text. Although it\\'s not just texting while driving, I feel as though you shouldn\\'t be on your phone while on the road period. Many people die from texting and walking into the street and not looking.\\n\\nOperating a car can be dangerous enough therefore you shouldn\\'t put your life in more danger by using a phone. A text will be there when you park your car. Imagine it being your son or daughter that gets killed because someone was texting while driving, so why put others or yourself in danger like that? Why put your freedom on the line like that? Would you be willing to risk it all for one text?   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nUpon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as \"smart phones,\" the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.\\n\\nCell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford\\'s Model T, and wouldn\\'t exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody\\'s pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.\\n\\nThe most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.\\n\\nThere is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.\\n\\nThe general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.\\n\\nThe best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n3 1      ',\n",
       " 'Using Phones While Driving\\n\\nUsing phones while driving has been a argument for what seems like forever. In my opinion using phones while driving will always lead to some type of horrific life changing , accident. Not many people consider all of the awful stories real people have went through involving a driver using their cellular on the road. Using your phone on the road should be taken as seriously as drinking and driving or being under the influence of any drug. Being on your phone can cause families to lose a loved one , a person to be completely disabled for life, and it puts yourself in danger along with others on the road.\\n\\nIn several different states all over the U.S they put laws that prohibit using your phone while driving. Alabama enforces the drivers age 16 and 17 who have held intermediate licence for less than 6 months cannot have a cell phone on them at all while driving. California bans all school and transit bus drivers and younger than 18 from being on their cellular while on the road.\\n\\nColorado however only punishes drivers younger than 18 who are caught on there phones while driving. Many of these states have different regulations to the safety on the road. But majority 47 states ban texting and driving for all drivers.\\n\\nFor those who figure texting and driving isn\\'t \"that\" serious or consider themselves master multi taskers , no one knows when something can change forever over the slightest glance. There\\'s been story after story about people losing family members, best friends, partners over that slight glance to their cell phone. People are so naive till it happens to them , but why , we should be preventing that from happening at all costs. No one wants to go through all that pain and guilt. Not only could you disable yourself you can also kill and disable another and have to live with the guilt for the rest of your life.\\n\\nUsing your GPS would be the only acception to using your cell while driving ,but even then you don\\'t need to look or have it in your hand. There has been devices made for your car for those specific moments. Today\\'s cars will read your text out loud to you and give you your directions there\\'s no reason to look at your phone. The technology we have today is changing and improving and everyday, decreasing the amount of tragedies a year.\\n\\nIn conclusion even though with the modern day technology improving and things are getting easier on the road. We all should still be in high alert on the road ,with no distractions. The smallest things could be so life changing and no one wants to be put in that kind of predicament.   ',\n",
       " \"Everyday fatalities happen from the use cell phones while driving. Research shows cell phones are a great factor in accidents. Research says a cell phone put a driver at a greater risk of a crash. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to text snap call etc. Also, they believe that hand-free set is safe because they can drive and not focus on the cell phone. However, they say that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support cell phones usage while driving, there are cases that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nSome people whose work rely on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Some business issues can be stressful and cause driving to be dangerous while talking about that situation a person may react differently which can cause an accident. The conversation they're can lower their driving ability if they get upset which can lead to you not focusing and losing control over the car. If people don't make a smart decision to not text and drive in their daily routine, they can put others at risk of losing their life.\\n\\nOpponents claim that hands-free set is safer than using your phone because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and also suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a cell phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists say that people talking over the phone to another person doesn't interfere with driving. The issues come is when a car suddenly Vere's of the road or into pedestrian traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't focusing on the road and using the cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of a lack of smarts, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it in the accident how can they reach or find it if they are flipped over in their car. People shouldn't fully depend on their phones they are not reliable; you might not have it all the time a good solution for the situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they aren't as reliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and other people lives.         \",\n",
       " \"Cell Phone Use While Driving\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using any kind of possibly distracting technology while operating a vehicle can put the driver, and others, at serious risk. Many people do not fully understand the risks that come with using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. While distracted driving they could hit someone or something, possibly leaving the the driver and that person or thing seriously injured, damaged, or dead. These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIn 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is extremely dangerous and risky. Drivers are not only putting them self in harm's way when using a cell phone while driving, but they are also putting other's lives and safety on the line. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.                               \",\n",

       " 'Cell Phone Use While Driving\\n\\nIt has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.\\n\\nOften times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren\\'t putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use \"reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,\" (\"Cell Phones\"). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver\\'s ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn\\'t the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (\"Cell Phones\").\\n\\nMany states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua\\'s Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver\\'s ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving\"), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.\\n\\nIn sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers\\' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Cell Phones.\" Teen Driver Source, www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones.\\n\\n\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving.\" Federal Communications Commission, 10 May 2019, www. fcc. gov/consumers/guides/dangers-texting-while-driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.\\n\\nMobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile device use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.\\n\\nIn the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones.\\n\\nIn 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done      \",\n",

Driving is needed for moving around quickly if your not feeling like taking public transportation to get to your location. Both the cell phone and motor vehicle were made to make our lives easier in the new era, but putting both together can cause issues and hurt yourself and others.

For an example, when you are on the highway in a song comes on that you don't like you take your eyes off the road to change it. This means the reaction time is affected by not being focused. Instead of changing it while driving wait until you come to a complete stop then change it.\\n\\nSo many car accidents happened in this day of age that people are being taken away from families.

I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com.

The phone calls and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's life and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait until you reach you reach your destination to do these things. Keep this nonsense of the roads. The roads were meant for you to drive on not to text on.

However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time, So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time in what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, It's because of conservation and lack of reaction at the particular- time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it most either they can't find it or reach it because it either on the floor or stuck in a seat. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you.

Honestly, we shouldn\\'t be able to handle a cell phone while operating a vehicle and here is why.\\n\\nWhen you are driving, your attention should be focused on the road. A cell phone is considered a distraction because if something is going on in front of you, then you need to be able to pay attention to these little things to keep yourself safe. Abrupt stops, crashes, no turn signals, motorcycles, the drivers on the other sides of you and stop lights/signs are all examples of things you would have to keep your eyes on the road for.

People are now more concerned about texting and driving than drunk driving; But is there a way to break the system?\\n\\nThere shouldn\\'t be a way around texting and driving. Our phones now have a \"DO NOT DISTURB\" motion button while driving because its that hazardous. Our cars became Bluetooth to help texting and driving to be prevented so there shouldn\\'t be a reason to pick up your phone as your driving. A way around is the wrong way because your taking a huge risk that can be avoided.\\n\\nTexting and driving is fatal. If a vehicle can have its own fatality rate... then we shouldn\\'t enhance the rate because of a text message that can definitely wait. Driving is an opportunity that was given to us for easier transportation, but if cell phones don\\'t stop being used while driving... consequences will be enhanced and driving privileges will be taken away. So to stop the fatal/injured rate, we should let the text message not be responded so we don\\'t have to have a first aid responder come to us for a mistake we could have prevented.      ',\n",

There are a lot of reasons you should not be driving while you are on your phone. It's all about your safety and others as well. Cell phones have been popular ever since they came out with touch screens to be honest. I think you should not use cell phones while you are driving because you may be the cause of an accident or more likely you'll be in one yourself.\\n\\nOne reason you should not use a cell phone while driving is because now a days you could get in trouble by the police. You are not suppose to be on the phone while driving anyway. You have to pay attention to where you are going. People die and come into this world about every second. If you continue to use your phone while you are driving then you'll get taken by one of those seconds.\\n\\nAnother reason you should not use your cell phone while driving is because what if you have people or kids in the car with you? You always have to think about safety first. Driving without a seatbelt is not safe either, it's also just like driving with your phone in your hand. Nothing is hard about putting your phone up while you drive at all. I would not want anybody to lose their life over that no way, not even on my worst enemy.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, I don't think your phone should be in your sight while driving.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor.\\n\\nDuring emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic   \",\n",
       " 'The majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis, this doesn\\'t mean they should be used while driving. It is a proven fact that more accidents are caused by using cell phones. In 2017 Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia says that \"according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distracion-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States.\"\\n\\nIt only takes a few seconds to look at your phone and get distracted. Within those few seconds anything could happen. In the state of Georgia the law is its illegal for drivers to have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support a phone. This is known as a hands free law. This still doesn\\'t stop people from using their phones. More than 16 million users on snapchat have admitted to using the app to take photos and videos while operating a vehicle. According to traffic safety experts, engaging in any activity that takes your eyes off the road and your hands off the wheel puts both you and other motorists at risk. Is a text or snap really worth your life and everyone around you. Nothing is more important than the safety of you and those around you. Distraction only takes a few seconds. It can wait!\\n\\nWe all have those moments where we need to know where we are going. This doesn\\'t mean we need to hold our phones. Car mounts are an easy way to make it hands free and allows your phone to be eye level.\\n\\nNowadays most cars have bluetooth to where you don\\'t have to pick up your phone you can just use your voice. There are also new apps that parents can have so teenagers can\\'t use their phones while driving. Apple also has a setting on their phones to where when you get a text it will automatically send a text saying you are driving and will respond when the car is not in any motion.\\n\\nThe roads will and would be safer if drivers would get car mounts or even just not look at their phones. In the end lives would be saved and less accidents would be caused. Your life is important and so is everyone else around you. It can wait!             ',\n",

Since there are so many cars on the road, safety is a pressing issue for the American public. At first it was concern over seatbelts, then drinking and driving, and now it is cell phone usage while driving. Since the rise of cell phones, more cases of drivers crashing due to being distracted by their phones. Due to this, it should not be allowed for individuals to use their phones because they have increased the risk of crashes, fatalites, and injuries.\\n\\nIt was reported by Edgarsnyder. com, that according to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million crashes are caused by cell phones every year. This displays the danger that cell phones pose to the everyday driver. And the danger only becomes more clear when one compares the cell phone crashes to the total number of crashes per year. According to USA Today, out of all the crashes that happen in the United States everyday, 1 out of 4 are caused by cell phones.\\n\\nThese statistics are exactly what shows how dangerous cell phones can be. Distracted driving is one of the main sources of crashes and they are a danger to the modern driver.\\n\\nEdgarsynder. com reports that every year, 390,000 people are injured in cell phone related incidents on the road. Distracted driving has now become more dangerous than drunk driving. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, 101,000 more people are injured by distracted driving than drunk driving. This clearly demonstrates the inherent danger cell phones displaywhen drivers use them. And since this past time is so dangerous, insurance for those have been caught texting and driving are paying the price. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, in 2011 the penalty for texting and driving was $2.35 added to the premium price. In 2017, the fine added was $226.36. That is an increase of 7,944% in the penalty price.

That is almost half the number people killed due to drunk driving, which also according to the NHTSA, is 7,000 people a year.

The action of using cell phones while driving is not only an unnecessary risk to the American public\\'s safety, it does not seem to have an impact on how dangerous it is to the teens of America. Also mentioned by Edgarsnyder. com, AAA conducted a survey in which 94% of teens said they knew that texting and driving is dangerous, but 35% of those teens said they did it regardless of how dangerous it was. This shows just how little the youth of America know about the dangers of distracted driving.\\n\\nThe NHTSA says that at any given time, 660,000 people are using their cell phones while they drive. This means that 660,000 Americans are gambling with their lives. Distracted driving is a epidemic in America, and it should not be allowed under any circumstances.

       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn the past few years, there has been a controversial debate on whether or not people should be able to use cellphones while on the road. This is mainly because the usage of cellphones while driving has increased the amount of distractions for all drivers on the road, especially teenagers. Because of this, many lives are being lost each and every day because people refuse to follow the basic safety guidelines. Causing cell phones to be considered as a huge distraction when it comes to driving. Distractions such as, talking or texting on the phone, as it can get drivers to take their eyes off the road for a few seconds, long enough to get into an accident. Therefore, it is extremely reckless, and highly dangerous to not only the driver but also to others driving on the road. Although cellphones cause distraction while trying to drive, people are no longer only talking on their cellphones, they are also browsing the global network. Some think that hands-free devices would be the solution.\\n\\nIn fact, in the United States, car wrecks because of distracted driving are increasing. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using a cellphone while driving, they continue to take this risk. Cellphones have become the standard part of everyday life and some people struggle to move their cellphones down while driving. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to use cellphones everyday while riding behind the wheel during the daytime hours. Cellphone usage while driving increases the driver's probability of causing the accident. Drivers are distracted, lessening the driver's awareness on the road, and as a result leading to more car accidents.\\n\\nAccording to statistics, 13 percent of drivers from the ages 18-20 admitted to using their cellphones at the time of the car accident. For instance some believe they can safely use a cellphone while texting and driving. Which has an overly negative impact within different aspects of our society including, the important aspect. In collusion it is time to change society's perspective on texting and driving because surveys show that it is one of the most dangerous action's one may possibly do while operating a vehicle. A large proportion, agree that texting and driving is a very dangerous activity so what would it take to make people quit utilizing their cell phones while driving? If you decide to take a cellphone and drive, you are not only risking your life but also all of the lives around you.      \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nPhone's and driving are very important parts in today's society. In order to get from one place to another, driving is very important in everyday activities. Driving is an essential part of life as we know it. Phones are very useful and everyone over the age of 13 years old has a cell phone. Phones have many different uses and can prove beneficial to every part of daily life. Phones and driving are very convenient and helpful. The use of phones and driving are a good thing, but when phones and driving are used together in an unsafe way, then it can be very dangerous. As you read, I will offer a better understanding of how phones and driving can help change the world for the better or it can also be dangerous when used incorrectly.\\n\\nSome helpful ways to use phones while driving is when you're in a new area and need to use the phone for GPS as you drive to get to a specific place. Another useful way to use phones while driving is to report roadside accidents in case of emergencies. Having a phone and driving can also provide you on traffic jams, bad weather, and accidents further down the road. Phones can also be useful when you're driving and get lost and a family member can use your phone's location to pinpoint your exact location.\\n\\nSome ways that are not helpful to phones and driving is when the phone becomes a bad distraction while driving. Not using a phone properly while driving increases the risk of deadly accidents. When using a cell phone while driving, it takes away from your concentration and focus from the road. When you are distracted, your reaction time is at it's lowest and that can prove to be fatal by causing an accident. A person using a phone while driving isn't paying attention to every aspect of the highway, and by doing so, put's everyone in danger.\\n\\nThere are laws to prevent phones from being used while driving. Many people have lost their lives to distracted drivers while on a cell phone. Georgia has a hands-free law, meaning you can not hold a phone while driving. This law is to help save lives and bring awareness of using phones while driving.\\n\\nI hope this paper has given you a better understanding of how useful phones can be while driving, and if not used correctly they can be very harmful. It is very important to educate others on the importance of using phones correctly while driving.\\n\\nReferences www. drive-safely. net www. nsc. org            \",\n",
       " \"Why You Should Not Use Your Phone While Driving\\n\\nMany drivers today are known for using their phones for locations, for example Lyft and Uber drivers need to use their phones In order to locate where the passengers are going and to also find them, but using your phone to make phone calls, texting, or using social media sites while in traffic Is very dangerous and unsafe for other individuals on the road. According to Pew Report about 59% of young adults are more likely to text and drive and more than a quarter of U.S. adults which Is 27% admit to texting while driving behind the wheel. These are dangers numbers which leads up to some of the reason why accidents happen.\\n\\nAccording to Chicago Tribune there are more than 67,000 active Uber and Lyft drivers In the U.S\\n\\nand all are know to use their phones to find the client or the destination In which the client Is going. This In my opinion Is a great use to use a phone while driving, not to be bias but their are other ways to phone that maybe more dangerous to others safe than that, like using your phone to be on social media, not only do you not have your phone In your hand but your not endangering the passengers (friends or family members) lives but If you have your phone In a phone holder, It ensure the safety of the passenger and also the safety of the other drivers, motorcyclist and pedestrians on the road.\\n\\nTeens like myself are very active on social media because of the time and age that we live In, It's one in many ways to communicate with people. As I stated In the thesis statement about 59% of teenagers actively use their phones while driving. It Is dangerous for them because not only are some of them new to driving, but If It's their parent's car and they get Into an accident, insurance may not be able to pay for It.\\n\\nIn addition to this that other percentage Is adults which Is 27 percent that use their phones while driving even though they are older and are suppose to know better they still use their phones on the road endangering other pedestrians. These percentages are dangerous and are Increasing over the years which shows in the amount of accidents (According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually).\\n\\nIn conclusion driving while using your phone is bad and it is not beneficial to anyone else on the road. The safety of all drivers and pedestrians depends on what we do and when we do it. Even though i think its ok to use your phone if your are an uber driver or lyft driver i strongly disagree with the use of cellphones while it's in your hands.                         \",\n",
       " \"Do you know the percentage of death caused by texting while driving? According to Edgar Snyder's website one out of four in the United States die or are critically injured from a car crash caused by a cell phone, this proves that cell phones while in the presence of driving should not be allowed.\\n\\nThere are many distractions that happen while driving and on your cellphone for instance; sending a quick message it doesn't take long right? According to a Virginia department of transportation website, it takes 3 seconds to have a car crash and fatally injure you or someone else, or even result in death. Although eating and driving is dangerous, studies from the Decide to Drive website showed that it's a lot safer to eat while driving then trying to operate your cellphone. Another distraction is talking on the phone with people. Some people can't multitask and risk their life to call/text someone. Trying to use social media such as snapchat while driving is extremely dangerous and a distraction we should try to avoid.\\n\\nSnyder's website also says about 660,000 drivers are trying to use their phones behind the wheel which results in 1.6 million car crashes in a year. When in a wreck caused by a cellphone your risk losing your licenses, killing someone, injuring yourself, or even killing yourself. This shows how dangerous it is to use your cellphone while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend not operating your cellphone behind the wheel. It will make the road safer, and result in a decrease of deaths and injuries. Don't risk your life to send just a quick message or make a quick phone call, drivers should focus on the road and nothing more. Let's be safer and put the phones down.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nWhile driving you're main point of focus should be on the road. A great number of people own a cell phone and the sudden urge to use it while operating a vehicle can be very tempting. There are many reasons, opinion, and facts based on why i think people should and shouldn't use cell phones while on the road. There are pros and cons depending on the situation. Here's why i think people should not use a cellphone while driving.\\n\\nUsing your phone is already a distraction and driving just makes it more worse than it is. While driving you have a lot responsibilities and using a phone just makes it harder to focus. Using a phone while driving is also probably illegal. In certain cases it is highly likely that you will receive a ticket. You can easily save yourself a ticket by just waiting till you are out of the vehicle reply to a text or call. Another reason is the passengers if anyone else is in the car. It is your responsibility to keep everyone in the vehicle safe. Using a phone while driving can increase the chance of a crash by a lot putting your life and the life of the passengers at risk. You can also put pedestrians at risk if you are not paying attention. There are also some reasons why i think it can be okay sometimes for people to use cellphones while driving.\\n\\nA main reason can be a emergency. Sometimes things happen at unfortunate times while you are driving, but that still is no excuse for you to use a phone while driving. Maybe waiting at the light to reply can sometimes be okay as long as you are paying attention. If you need to call or answer a call you can maybe put the phone on a mount so that your hands are still on the wheel and you still have your focus on the road. I personally know people who do this and in my opinion it's the safest way to answer the phone hands free while all your attention is still on the road. If you get a text or a call and you really can't help yourself, find somewhere to park. It doesn't take that long and it can save your life, the life of others, and reduce the chance of getting into a crash.\\n\\nThere's a lot of facts that show why texting and driving can be so fatal. 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the fact that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but 35% still admit to doing it, while 21% get into fatal crashes due to texting and driving. The percentage to get in a crash while texting and driving increased by 23%.\\n\\nAnswering a text takes your attention away for about 5 seconds and while going at 55 mph, that's enough to the length of a football field without even looking at the road. There are an endless amount of facts and statistics about this, and reading some to obtain the knowledge about this danger is great for your safety and the safety of others.\\n\\nIn conclusion, i don't think anyone should text and drive in under any circumstances because you are increasing the chance of a crash and risking lives. There is no excuse to why you should even pick up a phone while driving. If you absolutely have to because of an emergency or other reasons then you can park and take care of it from there. It's much safer and you can be saving lives                                                      \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nThey're car accidents everyday do to the several of reason. Cellular devices while driving is one of the biggest ways people today get in car accidents. In some states there's laws out saying you can't be on your phone while driving. I do believe that the law should be in place everywhere in the United states Because I witnessed myself people almost crashing because on their phones. Being on your phone while driving can create you to crash or to run a red light or stop sign because of not paying attention.\\n\\nWhile on your phone and driving can create a car accident because you're not focused on the road. Car accident can cause server injuries and sometimes death, so if you want to prevent these accidents from happening you should try to focus on the road and stay off your phone while driving.\\n\\nI think if you're going to be on your phone you need to be at a stopping point like at a red light or parked somewhere. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. So if people stop phone usage while in an operating vehicle the death and injury rate would go down tremendously.\\n\\nOnce when I was 12 years old I experience my first car accident.\\n\\nI was in the car with my cousin and we were headed to my grandmother's house for a cook out. We were all joking around in the car while playing loud music. I forgot to mention that my youngest siblings were also in the car with me. My big cousin started texting her friends while she was driving not paying attention to the road that much only looking up every once in a while and like 5 minutes later she was approaching a red light not noticing she didn't slow the car down. Next thing you know we bump into the car in front of us and creating an accident. That's the reason why I don't agree with allowing to have a phone while being in a car driving especially with other people in the car that could cause an injury and possibly death.\\n\\nWhen you have a phone in a car with you you're able to call of an emergency. If there's someone in the car with you you can tell them what you want them to say on the text message or in a call so you don't have to get distracted while driving. Some cars are actually able to hook their phone up to their car so they can answer the phone while driving and still be cautious on the road. Most people believe since they been driving and texting for so long that the possibilities of them getting in a car accidents low.\\n\\nBeing on your phone while driving is dangerous and it should be restricted in all states. It causes numerous of car accidents which comes with numerous of death and injuries. It safer to have your phone programed in your car so you won't be distracted. If you have to text someone then try getting to a stopping point so you'll not take any risk of getting in a car accident.   \",\n",
       " \"Cell phones while driving essay\\n\\nAre cell phones a necessity while driving? They do account for a lot of distracted driving accidents leading to serious injuries and fatalities. So, the real question is, is it worth it? No, I believe cell phones should not be in use while driving.\\n\\nThere are multiple reasons why phones are a liability while driving more than an asset. I want to cover the most important reasons. First, distracted driving, specifically with phones leads to drivers being 57% more likely to be in an accident. That's more than half likely to potentially be in harms ways than before if you just simply put your phone down. Statistics also show that using your phone while driving decreases brain activity, focus, and depth perception by 37%, which are all necessary factors required to drive safely. Many people lose their lives, and risk others lives due to cell phone activity such as texting, playing music, phone calls, and more. This could be your life, or your sons or your daughters or anyone you love. All it takes its to put your phone down and wait!\\n\\nCell phone use while driving is even more common in the youth. Teens are 79% more likely to pick up their phone or any device while driving, then adults. The number 1 cause of teen deaths are motor vehicle accidents, majority caused by distracted driving. Phones being the primary source of these distractions cause horrific fatalities. Parents and guardians should strongly advise their children not to drive with their phone on, authority figures such as government officials, should ban any use of devices such as cell phones, to prevent as many accidents as possible, and save lives.\\n\\nSo is the cell phone worth it? Is it worth your life? Absolutely not, cell phones should not be used while driving, all it takes is to put the phone down, save your life, and others.       \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nOur society\\'s reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.\\n\\nMobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver\\'s. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. Using cell phones at all while driving should absolutely not be allowed. Any amount of attention diverted from the road is incredibly dangerous.\\n\\nSome of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren\\'t for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving.\\n\\nEven the best drivers may be involved in a potentially life-threatening crash while trying to use their phone and drive. According to an NPR article on multitasking, when you are \"Switching from task to task, you think you\\'re actually paying attention to everything around you at the same time. But you\\'re actually not. You\\'re not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly\" (Hamilton). The article later goes on to state, \"You cannot focus on one while doing the other. That\\'s because of what\\'s called interference between the two tasks.\" Based off of this information, it can be inferred the concept of interference is also applicable to using a smartphone while driving. If a driver is busy paying attention to their screen, there is no way they could also be paying close attention to the road.\\n\\nEven five seconds of being distracted by a cell phone can be enough time for someone to get into an accident. One personal injury lawyer states, \"A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field\" (Miller & Zois). A range this large in a such a short time span conveys how much potential there is for injury when behaving so carelessly. Anyone who may claim it is safe for them to go on their phone while operating a vehicle because they are a master at multitasking is simply overconfident in their abilities. The truth is, it would be impossible for anyone to drive safely while distracted.\\n\\nWith lives at risk, texting and driving should be out of the question. Not only would such negligence put one\\'s own physical well being at risk, but all those around them as well.\\n\\nThousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others\\' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.\\n\\nCitations\\n\\n\"Demographics of Mobile Device Ownership and Adoption in the United States.\" Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech, Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech, 5 Feb. 2018, www. pewinternet. org/fact-sheet/mobile/.\\n\\nHamilton, Jon. \"Think You\\'re Multitasking?

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nIn the united states cell phones while driving has been a big issue. Several laws have been passed to prevent people from using cellphones while driving and limit using the phones while in a vehicle. The Nation safety council reports the people using cell phones while driving leads up to nearly 2 million crashes a year. And almost 400,000 injuries occur from crashes in a year. Texting and driving should be illegal because the crash rates of using a mobile phone while driving almost triple.\\n\\nPeople consider drunk driving to be more dangerous than texting while driving. The chance of an accident while using a mobile phone is six times bigger than the chance a DUI accident. It is said that in 2018 the safest way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands-free device via Bluetooth. Using the microphone on a phone while driving is illegal, even if it is not actually being held by the driver.\\n\\nEven though using a cell phone in a vehicle via Bluetooth is safer than holding the phone, it isn't completely safe. While the distraction is smaller using the microphone could still cause an accident and the driver would take responsibility in court. Its suggested that a person should just simply postpone calls until you arrived at where ever your destination was. The statistics show that younger drivers are four times more likely to cause a road accident due to using a phone.\\n\\nStatistics in 2019 show the 80% of the teens use cellular devices while in a vehicle. In the past few years rates of car accidents have increased extremely. People even ignore new implemented laws that have been put in place to ban using phones while driving. It is suggested that parents should also avoid calling their teens while he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving and after arriving at the destinations. Teens may always feel compelled to answer a parent call if received and that could be a big issue.             \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving :\\n\\nIn my opinion I think we shouldn't you cell phones while driving, because that causes lots of accidents. This has become the number 1 distraction for people. Most teens have road rage , and that is a bad feeling to have while behind the wheel.\\n\\nTeens swear they can multitask , no they can't that's why you should always focus on the road.\\n\\nThere are lots of ways you can use your phone though.\\n\\nIf you connect your phone to your car then, you will be good. Most teens like to buck and do what they want to do , and that's how consequences come in. That is why a lot of accident be occurring so much, you guys be hurt so bad. There is always for teens getting hurt and dying because they wanted to have they phone and be on it while driving.\\n\\nYou shouldn't want to text and drive anyways.\\n\\nIt doesn't take that long to hit someone soon as you look down or anything like that.\\n\\nThere are reasons why is shouldn't text while drive . The phone will take your eyes off the road for a long time, and\\n\\nTeens like they can do it but they can't safety first.\\n\\nYou will loose all of your focus towards your cellphone.\\n\\nYou will be sitting at the light for a while thanks to your phone. People will beep their horn and you will get a attitude.\\n\\nWe as young people, we think everybody is disrespecting us, but we be in the wrong cause we be on them cellphones while trying to drive. There has been a lot of teens dying than adults ,because of these cellular devices.\\n\\nI'm not gone lie, some teens do know how to text and drive. They know how to Multi-task and everything. Some teens know when to get on that phone and when not to . For Example, you at a red light you can take a look at your phone, and do what you have to do . When that light turn green put your phone down, and continue driving . Some teens want to get on the phone no that is not a good idea.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, Texting and Driving is the number one distraction for us young people. I want to inform young people that it's a lot of consequences that come with this distraction. My opinion to teens Is please stay off your phones while driving, these phones is that a good reason to lose your life. Cellphones are big distraction to us on the road. We need to banish phones when we are on the road , we should be able to make it to our distination very safe and sound.                                                    \",\n",
       " 'Phones and driving\\n\\nIn todays world people have access to phones all over the world. Most of the population own cell phones and use them everyday. That also means that people are using them while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while behind the wheel should be prohibited. The use of cellphones while driving causes the driver to become distracted, makes the driver less aware of what is happening on the road which causes slower reaction times and ultimately results in fatal accidents.\\n\\nWhen a person is driving and looking at their phone rather than looking at the road seeing what is coming their way they are distracted. Being distracted on the road causes so many accidents. In the article cell phone use while driving statistics and driving and texting fact it states, \" in 2018 according to the national highway traffic safety administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities.\" This proves that over two thousand crashes were caused by phone distraction just in 2018. If drivers were to stop using their phones while driving the amount of car crashes and deaths would go down drastically.\\n\\nThere is no positive effect of drivers using their phone while driving. If there is a passenger in the car with you they can take any calls or answer any texts for you. If you\\'re alone in the car you can leave your phone alone and wait until you get to your destination. Some people believe that using their phones while driving for even just one second won\\'t hurt them.\\n\\nIn an article mobile phones and driving safety it says \" when drivers talk on the phone the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on the phone.\" statistically this means that just being on your phone for a couple seconds increasing your chance of being in a fatal crash.\\n\\nAll over the world people use cell phones in their everyday lives and routines. Many people even use them while operating vehicles. Using a cellphone while behind the wheel causes the driver to become less attentive. Being less attentive means they have slower reaction time which causes more accidents. Being on your phone increases your chances of being hospitalized four times than not. This is why you should not be on your phone while driving.   ',\n",
       " \"In this generation we live in, millions of people who own a cell phone use it on a daily basis. What would happen if you were to use it while you're driving a vehicle? Can't even imagine the damage that can happen to the cars and yourself. There's a lot of consequences that can all lead back to you that we the community don't want you guys going through it. Here are some of them you can read so you won't regret it later in the future.\\n\\nLet's say you get a text from someone and you reach for your phone to read the text message and you text them right back. With those few seconds you use to take your eyes off the road to text, you can end up in a car crash. If you are a driver that either has a permit license or a driver's license know that texting while driving is not permitted on the road and can lead you to a big charge from the police. A charge like that can prevent getting your license suspended and add lots of points into your driving record. That's why in different types of states in the United States, they have passed the law of no using your mobile phone while driving.\\n\\nAlright, everyone should know this consequence or what would be the outcast of it. The injuries that you would have over that car crash. Damn, if it were me in a car crash I would be scared out of my life and praying to god I'm still alive. There's a lot of people who don't even cause the crash and end up getting really bad injuries just because of that one person who decided to choose a poor choice. Also, there's one more thing really traffic that can happen, and\\n\\nRamirez 2 that is death. The victim or yourself can end up dead in the car crash and that's something we don't happening.\\n\\nLast one, it's more important to me in my opinion and is similar to the last one but with one more thing added to it. If you do get in that car crash for being on your phone and you have someone else in the car with you like a friend. You are going to have full responsibilities not only for yourself, but for your friend as well. Your friend's parents are going to have a lot to say not only to you but to your parents too. From there, you are going to cover the medical bills for yourself and for your friend too. Imagine all that money over a poor decision you made by texting someone back. That money could have been used for something good like for college, a new car, or new house.\\n\\nIn conclusion, please don't make the same mistakes people failed to do. Be smart about your decisions while being on the road. Never use your phone on the road or it could lead to bad things or even worse.      \",\n",
       " 'Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many people also drive a vehicle. When these two things are combined, they can be very hazardous to someone\\'s life. Here are some reasons why you should not use a cell phone and operate a vehicle.\\n\\nThe main reason why you shouldn\\'t use a phone while driving is because it is a distraction. The National Safety Council says that using a cell phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. People are often hit or run over by a car only because the drive was looking at their phone. So many accidents are caused by cell phone use, because when you are looking at the phone; you are not looking at the road.\\n\\nThere are numerous ways to prevent car accidents caused by cell phone use. Children need to be taught the dangers of using a phone and driving. In Georgia we have a law that says, \"You have to have your phone in a cell phone holder while driving,\" if more states would do this we would be golden. And finally, you can use a Bluetooth earpiece, so you don\\'t have to pick up or look at your phone to answer it. We know how to stop so why don\\'t we stop it already.\\n\\nWhen it comes down to it, using a cell phone while driving is one of the most dangerous things someone can do. When you\\'re doing something as difficult as driving a car, the last thing you need is something to distract you. Preventing it is the best thing we can do right now. My grandma always tells me, \"When it comes to a cell phone, just remember that no matter what it is, it can wait.\"   ',\n",
       " \"Using phones while driving\\n\\nWithin our society we approach many problems though, one of the major problems is using a phone while driving. There are many reasons why this is a major problem but were only going to cover three. One reason why is because of the car wreck that occurs during this action. Another reason is because it is very illegal for people to proceed with action and they also create a bad influence on the kids that rides with them. Clearly, in my opinion i feel that people shouldn't use their phones and drive, now i'm going to go in depth as to why I feel this way.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council also known as the NSC shows that texting and driving leads to 1.6 million car wrecks per year. Even though people don't usually text and drive on purpose, when they do they sometimes become unlucky. Also in the united states every one out of four car accidents happen because of texting and driving. Therefore most of the united states car accidents happen because of this. This means the more people doing this the more wrecks it's going to be.\\n\\nSecond, while living in the united states it is very illegal to use your phone while your hands are busy. The distracted driving law states that georgia drivers have to have hands free or voice activated devices in order to talk on the phone. This means that you have to have a way to connect your phone to the car so you won't have to touch your phone. Even if you don't have a device you can connect to the car you still need some thing you can talk into in order to answer or call someone. If everyone would use these two devices there wouldn't be as many car accidents.\\n\\nFinally, the last reason why people shouldn't use phones while driving is because it brings a bad influence on the children that rides with them. Stats show that kids tend to self-teach themselves things that aren't taught to them second hand. This is also dangerous because the more negative influence people put on their children the more bad they will turn out. They will also begin to adapt to bad habits and end up in places they will not want to be.\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people know what will be the effects of this cause but still does it. This is very dangerous for not just you but the people that suffer from your accident. Even though the majority of people in our society still does this dangerous action, this is one thing that people should take into consideration .   \",\n",

I also think they should not have phones because it makes the driver side tracked. I also think it should be a certain thing they could use instead of the phones. I think they should not be on phones also because it can distract another driver. I think people should not have phones.\\n\\nI think they should not be abandoned from using their phones while in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it set up to where it locks in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it to where it wont let you press nothing or hook up bluetooth while the car is in motion. I think they should have phones also because they might need there phone to bluetooth and might want to use there phone to text someone to let them know how far they are or where to go.\\n\\nI think we should be able to have phones in the car. We need our phones to use the gps, listen to music, and asses things. I think we should be able to have phones but they make it to where we don't use our hands we just use a a car bluetooth. I also think that we should have car automatics.\\n\\nMore people losing their lives while texting and driving.\\n\\nDid you know that 7.2% rise from the previous year.

The reason why I think that people should not use your phones while your driving is because you can kill someone or yourself.\\n\\nIf you did not know this already, using your phones is just like the texting and driving.\\n\\nSome people might disagree with this claim, but the fact that 26% of motor vehicle crashes was because of a cell phone.

       " \"Texting And Driving Should Be Banned\\n\\nEvery year distracted driving causes approximately 1.5 million crashes, 400 thousand injuries, and nearly 3000 deaths, but there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. Fourteen percent of all fatal crashes involved cell phones, but there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. Distracted driving costs approximately $129 billion per year, but despite all of this, there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. It is absolutely necessary to ban texting and driving to prevent the deaths and waste of resources it causes.\\n\\nTexting and driving is dangerous. A vehicle travelling at 60mph will move 88 feet in just one second. This means that if the driver looks away from the road for even a single second, they will have moved 88 feet by the time they look back. When moving at high speeds in a vehicle, a lot can happen in a single second. The vehicle could drift off the road, hit another vehicle, or even hit a pedestrian. When a driver sends or receives a text, they're not looking away from the road for just one second, or even two seconds. They're looking away from the road for five seconds.\\n\\nFive seconds at 60mph is 440 feet. That's 440 feet the driver has moved without even looking at the road. This is something that happens every time someone looks at their phone to send or receive a text. This is unsafe and should be banned.\\n\\nTexting and driving, though it is banned in most states, is not uncommon. Three quarters of drivers who own a cell phone have admitted to texting and driving, despite the overwhelming majority of them knowing about the dangers. At any given time 7% of drivers are using their phones while driving. The knowledge that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to deter most people. Simply informing people that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to prevent them from doing it; texting and driving must be banned everywhere in the country.\\n\\nTexting and driving significantly increases the risk of a car accident, and accounts for a significant amount of actual accidents. Fourteen percent of all car accidents are associated with texting and driving, and it is the leading cause of car accidents, even more common than drunk driving. When a driver is texting while driving the amount of time their eyes are off the road increases significantly, by about 400%. Avoiding texting and driving could reduce the amount of time the driver has with their eyes off the road to a quarter and reduce the chances of an accident.\\n\\nTexting and driving causes 3000 deaths per year in the United States alone, and costs $129 billion per year. Every year many of the people that die as a result of texting and driving are drivers other than those who are texting. Often it's passengers, pedestrians, and even other drivers who are killed by distracted driving, but most deaths are the drivers themselves. The resources that have been lost because of distracted driving could have gone to something that could help people. But instead it is wasted because distracted driving has caused car accidents that cost a significant amount of money. Distracted driving causes many deaths and wastes a lot of resources that could be used to help people.\\n\\nDistracted driving is a major issue, but unfortunately, there are still some people who feel it should not be banned. It is still legal in three states and there are no national laws making it illegal. Despite 3000 deaths per year, $129 billion wasted, and it being the leading cause of accidents it is still not banned in some places. Texting while driving should be banned.\\n\\nSources 1. https://www. thezebra. com/research/texting-and-driving-statistics/ 2. https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving 3. https://www. iihs. org/topics/distracted-driving 4. https://www. cbsnews. com/news/why-so-many-people-text-and-drive-knowing-dangers/#:~:tex t=Most%20people%20do%20it%20anyway,against%20it%20in%20some%20states.\\n\\n5. https://markets. businessinsider. com/news/stocks/find-out-what-are-the-leading-causes-for-mos t-car-accidents-1027930348         \",\n",

       " \"Driving using a phone?\\n\\nWhen you are driving down the road and you get a phone call do you wait till you stop to answer it. Or do you answer immediately while your hands in the wheel. Do you think people should do that?\\n\\nIn my opinion i think people should not be able to use their phone but only on emergency. Have something to hold your phone up or a magnet on your dashboard. So if you get a call or text you dont grab and only using a finger and tap quick to answer it. Instead of grabbing it and putting it up to your ear. Doing that can prevent less crashes in my opinion because you you just give your phone a glance and a quick tap instead of holding it and trying to multi task looking at a phone and drive. By doing that you can be looking at the road and still give your phone a glance.\\n\\nIf you aren't allowed to use your on while driving. What happens if your wealthy businessman and you don't have anything bluetooth to talk to the person. How would you solve that problem but also that can be dangerous because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.\\n\\nBecause of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nPeople say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. But its a risk of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is Onstar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency they will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the nearest police, hospital and fire department giving them your exact location. Nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.\\n\\nIn conclusion if people don't stop using phones while driving the percent in people dying in car crashes won't change.   \",\n",

What\\'s your opinion on whether or not a driver should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Well my opinion is that I think drivers should not be able to u cell phones while driving.\\n\\nMy first reason on why I think that drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because it could cause a major distraction. Having a distraction while driving can cause any bad things to happen. Cell phone distractions have led to car crashes which has led to death and serious injuries.

Also the drivers and passengers around you. \" While using a phone is the most common form, distracted driving is anything that diverts a driver\\'s attention from the road, even something as simple as changing the radio station.\" Is an opinion from www. thecrcconnction. com . Some people go out and think they will come back fine but sometimes things can happen on the road.\\n\\nUsing phones while driving will always be a huge distraction even if some people deny it. Deaths and injuries have happened to kids, teenagers, adults, etc. This is why phones shouldn\\'t be used while driving to prevent these types of things from happening.

       " \"Phones & Driving essay\\n\\nWhy you should be able to use your phone while driving. There are many reasons to use one's phone while driving such as music, calls, and texting of course. If someone is driving through their neighborhood and they notice something suspicious at their neighbor's house on the way home they're going to report it to the police, immediately. But how are they going to do that while driving? By using their phone to contact the authorities. Say a family member was hurt in an accident and you were on your way home. You would be able to find out that they were hurt thanks to your cellphone. You can also use your phone for roadside assistance if your car breaks down.\\n\\nWhat if the radio in your car happens to go out? You've got your phone to play all the music you may or may not have illegally downloaded. This then gets you through your long drive from point A all the way to point D. what if you can't call someone while you're in the car well then just text them. You're running late to work so you text your boss that you're caught in traffic. Say your wife has gone into labor and you're in an important meeting and her sister text you, she's taking her to the hospital to give birth. How did she inform you she was going into labor texting while driving. These are all valid reasons as to why you should be allowed to use your phone while driving.   \",\n",
       " \"Is texting while driving safe?\\n\\nThis essay will help to discover why texting while driving isn't safe. There will be example why that texting while should be banned in all states. In common day society texting is like a drug people around can never put their phones down for at least a day unless it's broken or turned off to where you can't use your data. Most people that mainly die or gotten into these car accidents are teenagers reports say that over two thousand and six hundred teens have died each year by texting while driving. Right now as I write this to you I am getting ready to drive but I'm late I want to be ready for the wheel I'm currently observing my parents and watching them they hate ignorant and reckless drivers who don't pay attention and they want me to be a better driver if not the best driver so I won't be like these people who wreck and die from a car accident. I am disappointed in this common day society thinking that texting is more important than their lives. It's honestly sad that either drunk driving or texting while driving is more of a common issue of death than common reasons like strokes or heart attacks or natural causes like old age. Many people believe texting and driving isn't the issue it is the issue though people are just trying to ignorant to believe the lies that the media are teaching them but not me I am going to outshine the laws and not die from a car accident but rather old age when It's my time to go I will go not anytime early. But many people don't appreciate life until their stripped away from it instead of watching how they could've ended their lives within a status being known for something they did they disappear without people knowing who they really were. To any beginning drivers that are by themselves in the car without adult or guardian supervision pay attention especially late hours 8 Pm-4Am where you can't see that well outside use your taillights and headlights use turning signals when turning left or right or even merging in the lanes use your stopping signals when your about to make a stop at a red light and please put down the phones anyone who is texting and driving can wait till you get to your devastation safely.   \",\n",

In my personal experience of being in the car while the driver is on the phone. Was we got in a very bad wreck the car rolled three times, I was sitting in the back seat with my little niece and that morning my sister had got broken up with. So all this day of the wreck she was mourning, and after all day of being at my mom\\'s house we were packing up and leaving just pulled out the driveway and over the train tracks. It was just getting dark outside I would have to say it was 6:30 and my sister pulled out her phone and all I here was her crying and I looked up and we where going around a sharp turn. Then everything was going in slow motion Like I can not even explain how none of us got hurt. The police showed up about 15 minutes later and they started asking everyone if they were ok, then the police walked up to sister and asked \"if she was on her phone\" and my sister said \"yes\" so they wrote her a ticket and it was a BIG ONE. So do not text and drive it will cost you!   ',\n",
       " \"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.\\n\\nThe first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cell phones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.\\n\\nAlthough using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.\\n\\nIn addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This changes is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.      \",\n",
       " \"As for cell phones, Cell phone use while driving statistics show that how this behavior are common and dangerous for teen drivers. During cell phones while driving, 1.2 million car crashes back in 2013 that involved drivers talking on the phone, and also involving text messaging. Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help a lot of families manage this dangerous at its risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking on social media post can take your brain off task while driving. Coupled with inexperienced and lack of driving skills, cell phones can be deadly for teen drivers.\\n\\nTechnology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to be sure and be careful and explain to the teens to understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a commitment for teens not to use distracting devices while driving. Teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving any drawbacks. The benefits associated with not using a cell phone that includes, being able to pay better attention, being less likely to crash, and following the law. Texting and driving are really are really unhealthy for teens which can lead to death or a lot of trouble.\\n\\nAccording to integrity insurances, traffic safety administration, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is the time it takes to go from one end zone to another. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death of teenage drivers. Teens are not the only ones that are just guilty. According to the survey, conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, their model predicted text messaging while being involved in 6-60 percent of all accidents in the U.S. High school students who experienced these types of accident are very terrifying for texting and driving. Typing text messages reduce a driver ability at a certain direction to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events and also control a vehicle while in the lane and to also show respect to other vehicles.   \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nThis is my essay on why people shouldn't drive and talk on the cellular device at the same time. People shouldn't drive and text or talk on the cellular device why I feel this way, well I feel this way because a lot of things can go wrong when driving and being on the cellular device. When driving you shouldn't be on your phone you should be focusing on the road because once you take your eyes off the road so many things can go wrong. You can cause an accident you can kill somebody all because you weren't paying attention. I think it should be against the law to drive and text while can end so many lives. I say if you must answer a call or a text you should pull over and answer is no need to answer it while you're on the road just to stay safe. To prevent accidents, you just shouldn't be on your phones you should pull over to the side and answer it.    \",\n",
       " 'Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what\\'s hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else\\'s life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.\\n\\nFatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (\"On the Road).\\n\\nNearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\"). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\"). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving (\"Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others.\\n\\nTexting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (\"On the Road\"). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is.\\n\\nReaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol (\"Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving\"). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration (\"Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving\").\\n\\nIn 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 (\"Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, \"Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk.\\n\\nTexting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers (\"Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?\"). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason (\"Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?\"). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense (\"Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?\"). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 (\"Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?\"). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent (\"Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?\"). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison.\\n\\nIn summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, Edgar Snyder & Associates, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. htm\\n\\n\"Texting While Driving Is More Dangerous than Drink-Driving.\" Mobile Phones Proven to Save Lives in Emergencies, www. amta. org. au/articles/amta/Texting. while. driving. is. more. dangerous. than. drinkdriving\\n\\nCompare Car Insurance Quotes.

       " 'DON\\'T TEXT AND DRIVE!!!!\\n\\n\"When your distracted who is driving\"? When people that are driving get distracted they usually get distracted by a cell phone. Cell Phones often causes many accidents and they shouldn\\'t be used on the road at all. People should be more careful and they should always have their full focus on the road at all times because one small mistake could lead to a big accident,with that being said, \" Be smart and drive on\".\\n\\nPeople shouldn\\'t text and drive because texting and driving plays a big part in why people have accidents all the time. Teens are the ones that are most likely to text and drive . Did you know that 94 % acknowledge the dangers of texting while driving.Their were also 35% admitted to doing it,and 21% involved in a fatal car accident because of driving and texting. It has now become a law that everyone should not text and drive not only that, but your cell phone can\\'t touch any parts of your body and you are not to touch or look at it while your under the steering wheel. If your caught driving while texting there is a 200-500$ fine you would have to pay.Although maybe in some other states texting while driving could result in criminal misdemeanor charges. You would also be in prison or jail in georgia that is of course ,if you hit someone and cause any injuries to another driver. Did you know that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. A new person each day has lost their lives because of the rule that people break everyday. People should always be more considerate of others and maybe even their families. Also the people that has caused the accident they are the ones who are more than likely to suffer from the people they hit,because 9 times out of 10 ,people that were texting and driving probably wasn\\'t wearing a seatbelt. Ages 16 to 19 are three times more to get into a fatal car accident. The world would be a better place if people cared. Everyday someone live has changed or someone\\'s life has been taken away because people don\\'t know how to make smart decisions. People often feel like they are perfect drivers and they feel as though they will never get into any accidents and that they won\\'t ever get caught texting while driving. In the united states today 9 people are killed on the road and more than 1,000 are distracted by their cell phones, not much has changed ever since the law stated that people can no longer text while driving. Now that it has become a law its extremely dangerous now because it makes people want to pick up their phones even more. Other places in the united states has laws against cell phones. Which means that the chances of accidents occurring while reading text are extremely high. Texting and driving is a very bad decision to make .To prevent this from happening people should put their phones on do not disturb , people should keep their phones out of reach where you can see or hear it because if you hear it your more than likely to grab your phone to check it. Last but not least make a commitment to yourself that you will not text while drive. The world would be so much better if people haven\\'t lost their lives due to car accidents. No texting while driving could be more helpful to everyone because it could save a lot of people\\'s lives and it could save people from going to jail.    ',\n",
       " 'Drivers Should Not Be Able to Use Phones While Driving\\n\\nApproximately 25% of all motor related injuries and fatalities are caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving includes any activity that requires you to not have your full attention on the road and your surroundings while driving. A big factor in distracted driving is the development of cellphones over the past few decades and the common use of them while driving. Driving while using your cellphone takes your attention and focus off of the road and during the time someone takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone anything could happen. This poses a large threat to themselves, other people that may be riding in the vehicle, and the other people driving on the road. This is why drivers should not be able to use phones while driving.\\n\\nDistracted Driving been the source of countless motor vehicle related fatalities. According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, at least \"9 people in the U.S. are killed each day as a result of crashes involving a distracted driver.\" Using a cellphone while driving coincides with the idea of distracted driving. Many teens and adults feel the need to be on their phones while driving but this poses a large threat to innocent people driving on the road. Distracted driving has been considered by many as an epidemic that is entirely preventable but hasn\\'t yet been prevented. Though many states have passed a law criminalizing distracted driving, it still remains a large problem within the United States in itself.\\n\\nTexting and driving is among the most fatal types of distracted driving as \"when a driver reads or sends a text message, his or her eyes are off the road for five seconds, meaning that a person driving 55 mph would travel the length of a football field without looking at the road\" (Kitch). During these 5 seconds, there is a high chance of getting into a fatal car or vehicle crash which is a threat to other drivers on the road. People who use their cellphones while driving pose themselves as a risk to anyone in the vehicle with them or anyone driving on the roads around them.\\n\\nAll in all, distracted driving, and specifically cellphone usage while driving, causes a great threat to many people. Further action should be taken in order to prevent more deaths and injuries resulting from it and should be heavily enforced. The threat cellphone usage poses to people should stop people from being able to use their phones while driving.   ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Cars Just Don\\'t Mix\\n\\nAccording to the National Council, there are 1.6 million crashes reported each year.(Snyder, 2019) The cause? Cell phone use. Each of these drivers were either texting, or using the cell phone in some way. Drivers shouldn\\'t be permitted to use their cell phones in anyway while driving. The result of banning cell phones at the wheel would be a smaller number of deaths and injuries. This would also include hands free devices and phone calls. Anything that causes a distraction from the road included changing the playlist on your phone could cost you your life. However, there is a way that your phone could actually save your life.\\n\\nOn July 1st, 2018, Georgia passed a statewide \"hands free\" law. The law prohibits drivers to touch or even have the phone \"touch any part of their body\" while driving, this includes at stoplights too. The punishment for this, a 50 dollar fine and increases with each offence. The creation of this law came into effect after the \"no texting a driving\" law of 2010. People such as Representative John Carson say, \"It\\'s completely ineffective.\" The law is useless if making calls is still allowed.(Hafner, 2018) Since the hands free law was passed, the number of crashes reported because of cell phone use has decreased by two percent. Robert Hydrick, communications director for the Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety, points out that, \"Banning the cell phone isn\\'t the cure, but it is a step in the right direction.\" (Estep, 2018)\\n\\nKnowing how much of an impact the cell phone has on drivers life, iPhone designer John Casey with the help of other engineers, designed a feature on the iPhone that could actually save your life while behind the wheel. The \"Do Not Disturb While Driving\" feature on the phone can sense when you are driving or in the car. Your phone proceeds to pop up an alert that gives you the option to turn on the do not disturb setting. When on, the feature mutes texts and calls or sometimes normal functions of the phone to cancel any distractions. I know you\\'re probably thinking, what if its an emergency? Apple has that under control. If a message is sent to your phone, an option to send a prewritten message telling the person you are driving comes to the screen. If its an emergency, the sender can send it with \"urgency\" and the message will be bypassed to your screen. Since the creation of this setting, phone usage among drivers has decreased by 8%. (Baig, 2018)\\n\\nAs a result of enforcing the Georgia hands free law and features on the phone such as do not disturb, there will be a significant reduction of cell phone related car accidents in the near future. I strongly believe that in order to accomplish that goal, cell phones must be banned at the wheel. Our justice system must enforce the laws made to prevent more crashes from happening. As well as drivers using features on there phone to help them eliminate distraction. That text can wait.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nSnyder, A. (2019).

Most or all humans have cell phones in the world and use the phones every chance they get. But not all humans drive. You may be asking yourself if driving and texting is safe. Well follow along and i'll give you the inside scoop if it's right or wrong.\\n\\nJust in the united states 227 million people are licensed drivers. There are about 13.2 million young drives in the united states, between the ages of 15 and 20. For 2018 257.3 million smartphones are being used everyday. Most of the humans who have a smartphone drives a motor vehicle. Average number of car accidents in the U.S. every year is 6 million. More than 90 people die in car accidents everyday. 3 million people in the U.S. are injured every year in car accidents. Around 2 million drivers in car accidents experience permanent injuries every year. Thats alot of car crashes there are just in the us. The NSC has found out that every 1 out of four car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.\\n\\nAccording to the AAA poll 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting or calling on the phone, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. If you are still asking if using your phone while driving is safe its not. If there is a text or call that is really important than pull over to the closest store or parking lot. Not only will u be hurting or killing yourself you are also damaging other people's lives too.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nPhones an everyday distraction in life. They distract us from work and many other things. But none as bad as when you're driving. Many people die because of people looking down at their phones whale their driving. It kills on average of 10% of people 15 and up out of all the deaths from age all the way to being shot. 10% is a large number of people who died from these electronics so I belive there is a way to make it a smaller number.\\n\\n* Turning off your phone when you get in your car.\\n\\n* Putting your phone in the back seat so you would have to make a stop get out and open the back door to grab your phone.\\n\\n* Put your phone on the none setting so it won't vibrate or ring when you're driving.\\n\\n* Have your passenger use your phone for you.\\n\\n* Get more police on patrol and get them to watch for people driving and using their phones and if they find one give them a ticket and a court date.\\n\\nIf we follow these simple guidelines and one rule then the cause of death from using a phone and driving will drop. In my eyes I believe that the cause of deaths by this will at least half or maybe even more. This will cause people to feel safer to leave their house. This will also cause more people to go outside for walks meaning less people sitting in their house eating and only gaining to much weight.

Many people would agree that it shouldn't be allowed to use phones while driving, due to the distraction from the road, and gives you less time to react if something happens. Using a phone while driving brings more dangers to one of the most dangerous and daily tasks of a regular person.\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is a distraction from the road which is really dangerous not just for the driver but those around the car. In many cases of car accidents are caused by distracted driving with phones and this is most common with teens. These car accidents aren't just dangerous for those involved but can also cause death in many incidents.\\n\\nAnother reason why people shouldn't use their phone while driving is because, it would give the driver shorter time to react if something happened such as a pedestrian running into the street because if you hit them it will be the drivers fault and could get into legal trouble or worse yet the driver gets into a car crash and dies. People shouldn't use their phones because it only causes trouble.    \",\n",
       " \"Should people be allowed on their phone while driving?\\n\\nI think they shouldn't because that causes a lot of wrecks and other bad things. 26% of car wrecks are caused by the driver being on their phone and not paying attention. When you're driving and on your phone at the same time you're risking other people lives and yours too. There should be a new law that says there should not be any electronics placed in a moving vehicle. Plenty of people been killed in an accident because some careless human being decides to drive and text and take their eyes off the road.\\n\\nAnother thing if you're going to have your phone in your car turn it on do not disturb or silent so when you receive a phone call or text you will not be distracted. If you get caught by the police texting while driving there should be a huge fine to make people learn their lessons. Texting while driving is basically like drunk driving either way there's an accident that's about to happen, but it can never lead up to that point if you just put the phone down.\\n\\nAll it takes is just one little glance at your phone then BOOM!! An accident you just created. Just do everyone a favor and put the phone on hold. There's been a lot of innocent people dying because someone wants to be irresponsible and text while driving.          \",\n",

This may seem out of the ordinary but it's happening way too often, with so much access to technology people can't stand to resist the temptation of a simple text which can mean fatal consequences. This is why people should not be able to use cell phones in any way.\\n\\nCell phone usage has been on a steady incline, with new and better phones out in the market is letting people have more access to these products. While cell phones are helpful in many ways, they can lead to people taking calls at inappropriate times such as when driving, which can lead to avoidable injuries that can be fatal and could have been avoided by just being a responsible driver. Distracted driving accidents account for almost 25 percent of all collinson crashes. In 2015 319,000 injuries were reported that involved distracted driving.\\n\\nFurthermore phones were involved in most of these accidents if we raise awareness from a younger age and set good examples for the next generation, we will have fewer car wrecks and pointless death will be less common. These are the reasons why phones should not be used while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nWorks Cited https://teensafe. com/100-distracted-driving-facts-statistics-for-2018/\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving 1. Today the majority of adults and teens own or operate a cell phone. The average person is claimed to spend about three hours on a cellular device daily, for others that number is much higher. With cell phones constantly being upgraded and advancing, it makes it more tempting for individuals to buy them and cause people to use them more than what is necessary. This leads to adults and teens to even be tempted to use them even while on the road. Should drivers be able to use a cell phone in any captivity while behind the wheel? Even if it's for something as simple as only using it for GPS directions. It's all up to the way the driver uses that privilege. The usage of a phone while driving should be avoided as much as possible, especially texting and driving. When you think about it, texting and driving is the equivalent to driving intoxicated or under the influence. By taking the chance and texting while driving Your putting you and innocent pedestrians in danger.\\n\\nToo many people have lost their lives because someone was not being cautious, being on their device and not paying attention to the road, distracted by their phone trying to reply to a simple message that can wait till you are safely parked or not on the road. Why risk getting a ticket and having to pay money or even getting arrested or possible taking a life just by being careless and making a little mistake you could have easily refrained from. Your only increasing the chance of you getting into an accident and endangering someone's life, and if a wreck does happen is likely insurance would cost more because of the situation. You being in the wrong and caused the wreck, meaning you would have to pay more for the insurance Texting and driving is not only very dangerous it has been made illegal but yet there are still individuals who feel they just need to use their phone while behind the wheel. In conclusion, the overall usage of a cell phone.....that's why teenagers shouldn't drive with the cell phone an be on the phone because u can be focused on the phone with messages and calling an get in a crash an that's good if You got a GPS but phone are not good while driving in the dark it can costed Accident especially when you can't see an got the light in yo face an it's always good to have another person in the car with a phone an your driving.   \",\n",

When they are driving.\\n\\nAs a society we have became so focused on how much we can do at one time that we don\\'t realize how it could be effecting our personal safety, and the safety of others around us. When driving its already pretty hard to stay focused on the road. Let alone with a handheld phone as a distraction. The roads are shared for everyone and not just you, don\\'t let your dumb decision affect others life on the road as well.\\n\\nErratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if its causing us to be late to work school or whatever else it may be.\\n\\nIn the article made by Consultancy Buss Maven Labs, Scott Clark says \"A young women killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.\" She may not have intended to end the poor boys life but now she has to live with that.

Talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. Therefore, drivers have to operate the vehicle already. Why let a cellphone distract you trying to operate it at the same time? Cellphones while driving have caused thousands of wrecks across the world, some even leading to death upon the passenger or the people in the other car.\\n\\nThink before you pick up your phone behind the wheel.

It is what went wrong, but the problem with texting and driving is that it is not always something that goes wrong, but when it does go astray, it is usually life-threatening. How are people supposed to learn from an outcome that has never happened to them? The first step of learning from a mistake is to own the mistake, but it is hard to own a mistake when it does not feel like one. Well, the easiest way is to learn from someone else\\'s mistake.\\n\\nLiz Marks was a popular girl, a model even, but that all stopped when she used her phone while driving. She read a one-word text before she even had time to respond; she had crashed into a truck. Liz had to be airlifted from the accident to the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center, and the first responders did not even think she would make it. She ended up spending a month in the ICU to have various surgeries. After that, she spent another three months at the Kennedy Krieger Institute relearning reading, writing, walking, talking, swallowing, and chewing. She survived, but she has severe facial trauma. She is blind in one eye, cannot smell, has lost some of her hearing, cannot even make her tears, and cannot sleep without medication.\\n\\nAlexandra Mansonet was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter after she killed someone while texting and driving. The lawyer stated, \"It\\'s going to be very difficult for her to deal with the fact that at sentencing she could be incarcerated for something we are all guilty of doing on a daily basis.\" She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Not only does she have to spend ten years in prison for something that almost everyone does, but she will forever have to live with the guilt of knowing her actions killed someone.

This averages 240,900,000 people a year, which is 5% more than the number of licensed people in America. According to the NHTSA, between 2014 and 2017, 1,366 people died from crashes involving drivers using cell phones. 1,300 people are enough to constitute a massacre, a massacre where the weapon used was the send button. A massacre composed of people saying what they want to eat, and when they are going to arrive, that is if they end up at their destination. A massacre made up of people just like any other people.\\n\\nPeople who never thought it would happen to them.\\n\\nEvery time someone looks at their phone while driving, it\\'s a gamble.

       " 'Phones and Driving: The Dangerous of Both at Once\\n\\nDriving is something that most people in the world do. It is important to a person\\'s daily life, because driving is used to go from place to place. Phones are also something that most people have, and deem important. Phones can be used to browse the internet, and to be able to contact someone in an emergency. However using the phone while driving is not only a bad thing, it is dangerous.\\n\\nUsing the phone while driving is usually referred to as Distracted Driving. Distracted driving is dangerous for not only the driver, but also those around the driver. The average amount of time it takes for a person to read a text is around five seconds. If the driver is traveling at 55mph (88.5kmh), which is standard highway speed, in those five seconds the vehicle had covered a distance of 403ft (123 meters). The situation on the road could easily have changed in that distance which could cause an accident. According to the CDC, out of the 2,443,000 vehicle injuries that occurred in 2015, 391,000 of the injuries are due to Distracted Driving. Then out of the 35,092 vehicle deaths that occurred in 2015, 3,447 of the deaths are due to Distracted Driving (Distracted Driving | Motor Vehicle Safety | CDC Injury Center). Although these may not seem very large in terms of percentage these numbers are still quite big.\\n\\nDespite both driving and phones being very important parts of a person\\'s life using a phone while driving is a very dangerous thing. Due to how dangerous it is to use a phone while driving people should not be looking at their phone at all while driving, but hands off things such as Bluetooth connection that were set up before the vehicle is in motion should be allowed since a person is not taking their eyes off the road. Distracted Driving is an incredibly dangerous thing to do, and that is why using the phone while driving should not be allowed.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"Distracted Driving | Motor Vehicle Safety | CDC Injury Center.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, https://www. cdc. gov/motorvehiclesafety/distracted_driving/index. html   ',\n",
       " \"Phones V.S. Driving\\n\\nNowadays people are on their phones all the time on a daily basis, whether or not these should be allowed while driving is an easy answer. They shouldn't be allowed at all while driving for reasons I will state.\\n\\nPhones are distracting. Phones aren't like other distractions they almost always require your full attention (unless it's calling). If your browsing social media while driving you're going to be reading what's on your phone rather than drive or you will be playing a game on your phone rather than watching the road you're watching the game. when your texting unless you know the keyboard like the back of your hand then you're going to make typos and grammar mistakes which will lead you to be glued to your screen to make a good text.\\n\\nPhone use in general is just a bad idea. You aren't giving the road your full 100%\\n\\nattention while using a phone and if you slip up and look at your phone for a second you can cause an accident. Some things while driving need split second reactions like, someone in front of you stopping without warning abruptly or a car swerving into your lane or a person walking onto the road, if you're on your phone while driving and any of these things happen you're sure to cause an accident or even worse kill someone.\\n\\nTo play devil's advocate the one caveat to this essay is calling. With Aux cords in virtually in every car and Bluetooth becoming more mainstream in more recent cars, you don't need to be holding a phone to call someone. You can do it all from your steering wheel with newer cars if you get a call while driving your car will accept the call and you can talk while not even touching the phone. While aux cords aren't as good as Bluetooth there still amazing at keeping you hand free, you can just pick up your phone while its hooked up to the car and pick it up and put your phone down while talking on the phone though the car.\\n\\nIn conclusion phones should not be used at all for things like that you need to be watching the road for anything that gets literally and figuratively thrown your way, phones are just straight up distracting and you should not be distracted while driving for reasons stated earlier and because it's just irresponsible the only exception to this is using an aux cord or\\n\\nBluetooth while calling someone.   \",\n",
       " \"It's a nice, peaceful day outside. The wind slowly blows through the trees, and the sun shines brightly. You're driving with your window down, and you can smell food in the air. Your destination is your mom's house to eat dinner with the family. Suddenly, your phone pings in the passenger seat. You reach over to tap it, so you can see what the notification was. Before you even get over there, a large horn sounds through the air along with the sound of your car smashing into another. You've just crashed your car into another, injuring yourself and the people in the other car. It was all because of that notification catching your attention. Clearly, phones should not be allowed out in cars.\\n\\nPhones should always be on silent in the car. Our brains are trained to jump at the sound of our phone beeping. Our genes have been shaped through generations to seek rewards, and the little notification sound triggers our brain's carnal function to check for a reward. You literally cannot for a long time after a phone beeps without touching it unless you have a really strong sense of willpower. If our brains are trained to check our phone as soon as it beeps, why should we risk our brains immediately going for the phone in the car when we can just turn it off?\\n\\nPhones should also not be visible, because we are inclined to touch it when we see it, especially if the screen lights up. It only takes one moment of somebody's eyes leaving the road for there to be a life-altering crash. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. This means that 1.6 million times a year, a phone caused somebody to crash their car. That one moment they needed to look at the road and they didn't, happened 1.6 million times in one year. Without a doubt, if phones weren't out in those cars, those 1.6 million incidents would be non-existent.\\n\\nLast but not least, phones should be put out of the driver's reach at all times including red lights. Undoubtedly, with technology today, there should be no excuse for someone to be on the phone while driving. You can click your steering wheel for whatever you need in most newer model cars. Taking your eyes off the road endangers both you and other people on the road.\\n\\nOne of the studies of Harvard concluded that 2 in every 3 people are addicted to their phones. Sometimes we have to take precautions, simply because we just cannot control ourselves sometimes. A good percentage of people whip out their phones at a red light without even thinking because they think they're safe. Even at a red light, there are still cars moving around you, consequently, you must always be alert on the road.\\n\\nPhones should not be allowed to be seen, hear, or be in reach when in a vehicle. It puts human lives at stake, and it ruins others. Having a phone in the car is one of the most dangerous things you can do in a vehicle. Next time, you stop at a red light and see somebody on their phone ask yourself this. Is whatever they're doing worth it?   \",\n",

People should not be using a cell phone while driving because its a major distraction for the driver and can cause someone to get hurt or even killed.

A study was set in place to determine the rate of increase on cell phone related crashes each year and the number is a shocking 1.6 Million crashes and of that, 390,000 are either injured or killed. Cell phone related crashes are the number one causes of death inside the U.S's borders for the past 10 years and needs to be solved fast. The best way to regulate and control this dilemma is by implementing a law similar to Georgia's hands free law to every state to ensure that no one will drive and use a cell phone.\\n\\nThe only instance to which a person should be using a cell phone while driving should be by law enforcement or if you are a passenger in the vehicle. The driver needs to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or even just him/herself arrives to their destination on time. Even when a driver is not using a cell phone, they are still distracted by a passenger even when they are trying to show the driver something on another phone and cause an accident. The driver has only one job and is to keep all souls in a vehicle safe and secure at all times and should not be distracted.    \",\n",

Not only is this decision incredibly dull, for you could injure yourself but others as well, but there are many reasons why using a cell phone while driving is dangerous,\\n\\nOne of the biggest reasons why using your cellphone while driving is dangerous is that texting and driving not only puts you in danger but will put all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. Did you know \"that an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council? The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year\"(Center and Statistics, 2020) in Georgia alone.

       " \"Texting & Driving\\n\\nUsing your phone while driving is a worse combination than a chicken sandwich and mayonnaise. Most people with common sense know this. You may pull it off a few times, but one day, you will look away at the wrong time. There are many reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving. The first one is pretty obvious.\\n\\nOne reason you shouldn't text and drive is because you won't be focused on the road as much. You're at more risk of getting into a car wreck. The brain is focused on the next message you're about to send, rather than the road. Driving requires as much focus as possible. Even something as small as checking the time can put your life at risk.\\n\\nAnother reason is that you could possibly kill someone with your vehicle due to not being focused on where you are going. You could swerve in a different lane unintentionally and hit another driver, causing them to possibly spin out of control, or drive into a wall or tree. The best thing to do is to turn your phone off while operating a car just so you can focus on your next destination. It doesn't matter how much experience you have. Accidents happen when you least expect it.\\n\\nFinally, the last reason you shouldn't driving and text is because you could unintentionally get lost because you made the wrong turn, or you missed your exit. It is so easy to miss your turn even without a phone in your hand, so imagine actually being on it. Some people have short attention spans; they can't multitask like others. Unless you're using your gps, you shouldn't even be looking at the screen.\\n\\nMany deaths have occured because of the driver's false confidence of being able to text and drive. There's no way to finesse your way around it. Statistics show that you're more safer in an airplane than in an actual automobile. Driving is already risky as it is. By you using your phone, you instantly put your life in even more risk, and also others. So many more people would be alive today if they would just turn their phones off before turning on their car.         \",\n",

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   \",\n",

With phones being so prominent in today's world texting and driving has become a dangerous habit a lot of people participate in. Because of this a question has occurred, should drivers be able to be on the phone and drive?\\n\\nThesis\\n\\nDrivers should be able to be on the phone and drive because talking and driving is done all the time and cell phones are too important to be completely inaccessible in the car.\\n\\nOne of the reasons why drivers should be able to access their phone is due to phones being the main way of communication in the modern world. To completely cut off that communication when driving could be detrimental for people who need to be prepared to respond to people ASAP. There's also GPSs on phones that people use for navigation that would now be banned due to making phones illegal to use during driving.\\n\\nThe other reason to keep phones legal while driving is the actual lack of danger while driving and using a phone. While texting and driving is dangerous. Just calling and driving should not be an offense. As people talk and drive with each other all the time. And being on the cell phone is essentially the same thing.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nSo in conclusion people should be able to use their phone while driving.

Since the release of this law, accidents due to phones have greatly diminished. Although in today\\'s society cell phone have become a critical part of everyone\\'s life, they have also become the epitome of distraction and addiction. The dependence people have on their phones has become so great that they are willing to risk their lives, driving blind for a couple seconds, going 60 mph, just to text back \" LOL.\"\\n\\nAlthough these law are in place, they still don\\'t stop people from checking their notifications on their phones. Even with a two second checking of ones phone, it can cause their chances of crashing to become higher. If you are driving at 55mph and you looking away for 5 seconds, it\\'ll be like driving the distance of a football field. This means that you possess a large risk to not only yourself, but everyone driving around you. 1.6 million people each year are involved in car crashes and a large portion of these crashes are due to cell phone usage.\\n\\nOne of the obvious consequences of texting and driving is one\\'s inevitable death. Texting and driving, or just merely scrolling through your notifications puts yourself and others at risk since it\\'s basically like driving blindfolded for a couple seconds. But people don\\'t realize this, they\\'ll see a clear road and then decide to pick up their phones. However, anything can happen within those few seconds. Texting and driving poses a threat to others on the road as well, so even if the car crash wasnt fatal on your end, you could have taken someone else\\'s life. Another consequence of texting and driving involves non-fatal injuries. Although some car crashes on non-fatal, injuries are prevalent. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. A broken arm, concussion, lacerations, are some of the many injuries that are common after a collision. But there are some injuries that are far worse. Some people end up paralyzed, mute, and some even lose recollections of past memories. Imagine forgetting who you were, your family and friends, all for a simple text message.\\n\\nOn a different note, these car accidents are indeed preventable. States like Georgia are stepping up and passing laws to reduce the number of car accidents with the hands-free law. As previously mentioned, the number of car accidents have declined. Fatal crashes were down 6 percent in 2018, said Harris Blackwood, director of the Georgia Governor\\'s Office of Highway Safety. And for those who are caught using their phone while driving are given a pretty hefty fine. Additionally, on a more market scale, there are hands free devices available for purchase such as bluetooth earphones for calls and windshield phone mounts. Furthermore, the newer cars that are coming out are now embedding technology into the cars system to prevent drivers from using their phone. Drivers can easily browse through music, answer phone calls, and navigate to their desired destination.\\n\\nA life can be lost by simply responding to a text or peeping at a notification. It\\'s not worth it to risk your life just because you decided to look at your phone for a couple seconds. It\\'s also not worth it to be on life support the rest of your life because you were recording a video to upload on snap that never ended up being uploaded. You also have the life of others in your hands when you make the decision to use your cellular device while driving. It\\'s like driving under the influence but you\\'re blindfolded. Life is already short to be texting and driving.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nAs of 2017, an estimated 270 million people have a cell phone in the United States. Cell phones have been an everyday object that is addictive and is used for the majority of a day. In particular, cell phones are commonly used while driving, even though it sounds dangerous.\\n\\nDriving requires focus on the road as well as the driver's surroundings and using cell phones while driving prevents that from occurring. Cell phones should not be used while driving because of the many dangers that tend to result from it.\\n\\nCell phones are extremely distracting because of the large amount of focus operating one requires. While driving, cell phones divert a driver's visual focus from the road to the screen of the mobile device which is very dangerous. The driver isn't able to see what's in front of them because their eyes are locked in on the screen of a cell phone which can possibly lead to a variety of negative outcomes. Texting while driving can lead to harm to health, government involvement, and vehicular harm.'\\n\\n1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting while driving and in the United States over 1.6 million car crashes occur annually. That means that every year over 400,000 car accidents result from texting and driving. Cell phone usage itself has a very negative impact on the body's health due to the blue light it transmits. The blue light hurts the eyes and is extremely detrimental while texting and driving. A driver must have good eyesight so that they are aware of their surroundings but using cell phones/mobile devices while driving hinders that. Studies have shown that texting while driving makes a driver lose focus more on the road than a driver being under the influence. Cell phone usage is very harmful because if an accident happens , then several degrees of physical injuries can occur and death can happen if the injuries that result are too serious to treat. Cell phone usage while driving should not be allowed due to the risk it has on the health of a driver.\\n\\nIn most states, texting while driving has become illegal due to the many health risks that result from it. Police officers have the ability to give a driver a citation/ticket for texting while driving. However, a significantly large number of drivers have found a loophole to evade getting a ticket and/or citation. They would not text and drive but instead they would have their cell phones in their hand but not actually text and drive. In order to counteract this loophole, some states have enforced a policy which states that a driver can be penalized for being in possession of a cell phone/mobile device when the vehicle is in motion. These policies are implemented so that no harm can occur due to cell phone usage while driving.\\n\\nUsing cell phones or mobile devices while driving can negatively impact the vehicle that a driver is driving whether it be a coupe, sedan, crossover, minivan, or truck. Texting while driving can lead to the quality of the vehicle declining due to any damage it may face such as a wreck. On the financial side, the vehicle's interest rate will most likely increase because texting while driving can lead to receiving tickets and/or citations that a driver potentially may receive.\\n\\nThe vehicle itself is something that the driver should bring into consideration and not use their cell phone/device while driving so that no harm comes to the vehicle.\\n\\nThe concept of using cell phones/mobile devices while driving is one that needs to get rid of immediately. There are countless outcomes that result from cell phone usage while driving and all of them are negative ones which shows that it should be banned. The health risks are severe as well as the vehicular risks and the government has had to step in because of the realization that using cell phones while driving is a lose-lose situation no matter what.   \",\n",
       " \"Have you ever drove down the highway or just been at a red light and look over and see all the people with cell phones up to their head or in their lap looking down at them? Its everywhere, and it`s not a safe habit to get use too. Matter in fact 1 out of 3 car wrecks are from people being on their cell phones not paying any attention to the road.\\n\\nCell phones have evolved over the years and I thinks that is what is so bad about them because they keep getting these better updates and things and people just feel the need to carry it or be on it where ever they go. Don't get me wrong, cell phones are a nice thing to have on you but you got to remember their not going to save you. They are they for you to use, you control yourself so you take the action and set the cell phone down whenever you get in the car to drive. Teenagers are addicted to cell phones like crazy, which is one of the top reasons injury's happens to young adults.   \",\n",
       " 'Operating a cellular device at the same time as handling a vehicle is so dangerous, due to texting and driving becoming the leading cause of death among teenage drivers, one out of every four car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving, that boils down to roughly eight people being killed each day and roughly one thousands one hundred and sixty-one injuries in crashes that involved distracted driving.\\n\\nTexting and driving appears to be a significant problem among young drivers. Studies show that drivers on a mobile phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards. It is important to go ahead and deal with this issue for young adults now, so that they can break this habit and not have to deal with any future issues.\\n\\nDue to the constant concern of this matter, many states have decided to enforce a hands free law. The different stats in the United States that have enforced this law are, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia plus Washington, D.C.\\n\\nLaws and facts show several reasons why it is unsafe to text and drive, but when it narrows down, the driver must take under consideration the different situations that can affect them self and others in the vehicle as well. Younger drivers do not realize the importance of considering the passengers, other motorists, or pedestrians, there are so many things that can happen around a moving vehicle, and just the slightest move can have the worse outcome for everyone.\\n\\nAlthough there are certain laws about the matter, most drivers either avoid the law or do not fully understand the importance of it. There are other ways to get through to someone about this matter, such as, telling someone about how uncomfortable it is, or how risky it can be, another way is just simply taking the phone from them.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driving while on a phone is something that should be strictly advised against, the next time someone gets in a vehicle and is preparing to drive away, they should think to themself about what could happen if they acknowledge the little device in their lap, think more responsibly and get to the destination safely.

       " \"I think that drivers should not be able to operate while on the road because they can get easily distracted, they don't pay attention and could crash, they can fatally harm the people on the road. There have been a lot of different accidents because of people working on the road on their phone, or just not doing their jobs right from the start.\\n\\nDrivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business.\\n\\nAccording to EdgarSnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. The site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. If drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort.\\n\\nOn average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. With people working on the road that average is going to double faster. Being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. People will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, From July to September about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. Of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast.\\n\\nA lot of jobs that require working on the road like Uber, Lyft, Uber eats, Doordash, all have requirements for the job. Different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them.\\n\\nFor those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. Driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. If there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road.\\n\\nIn conclusion i think that people should not be able to work on the road. Drivers get easily distracted, they don't pay attention, they don't do their jobs. Working on the roads can get very distracting. Working on the road is very dangerous. It is very life threatening.   \",\n",

This is incredibly dangerous especially since it has been scientifically proven that it is impossible to multitask. \"Trying more than one thing at a time - especially anything potentially dangerous, like texting while driving - seriously compromises our ability to complete the tasks safely and well.

Only this necessity to use phones at every second has consequences. While conducting a vehicle, people use phones whether it is at a stop sign or even while driving. This distraction can lead to car accidents, deaths, and unnecessary bills. Although the use of phones is beneficial at times it is to be used at the right time. The use of cellular devices should be prohibited while conducting a vehicle, as the safety of others is at risk.\\n\\nAs a society, we are focused on multitasking in order to complete tasks quicker but multi-tasking while driving can cause car accidents.

The more and more people think about using their cellphones while driving, the more and more anything fatal can happen at any second. People often become terrified of the possible outcomes that can occur while being distracted by their cell phones. People often drive with their little sisters or brother, perhaps even babies and kids. Imagine feeling your phone vibrate and you feel like you have the need to take a quick second to look at what was the vibration on your phone.\\n\\nSomehow in that one second you took a glance at your phone, you crashed with a family member inside the vehicle and had to be sent to the emergency room. People would feel very guilty about the consequences they have caused due to the usage of their cellphone while driving.\\n\\nCell phones are used for communication. In the beginning of the cell phone times, were primarily used for calling other individuals. Presently they are more often used for text messaging, and according to distraction. gov , because texting requires visual, manual and conmentive attention from the driver, It is by far the most alarm distraction. Cell phones are also used for entertainment such as browsing the web, watching movies, playing games, and listening to music.\\n\\nFatal car accidents can occur while using your cellphone while driving. An example of this would be passengers that are located inside a car where the driver has made the decision to use their phone while driving, which can lead to losing their lives because due to the driver making this decision they're putting their own lives at risk and lose their lives along with the driver. Also other passengers and drivers that are located along the road are putting their lives at risk as well due to this driver's decision. Pedestrians can also be hit by drivers that are distracted. An example of this is children who are playing in the streets with their toys and friends, or elderly men and women lost their senses could be hit by a car, they wouldn't know what hit them until it already happened.\\n\\nSome people might use their phones for specific reasons, for example using it as a navigation system to find your way somewhere, or also to talk on the phone if there has been an emergency. In 2010, a total of 355 car accidents happened in the united states, and of those 355, a little less than half of those were deadly accidents that happened due to using cell phones. This is where people need to understand the dangers and listen to what the state has to say about phone usage while driving. It's no good for people to use their phones while operating their vehicles because of the accident and death rate.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by being informed about the types of cell phone usage, the Multiple dangers associated with cell phone usage, and the reasons why people shouldn't use their phones, you can now realize just how important your decision is whenever you decide to make your choice to use your phone while driving. Remember that you are the one that makes the choice, so make the right one by not only looking out for your safety, but also for the safety of others around you.   \",\n",
       " \"The Dangers of Driving While Using the Cellphone\\n\\nI believe that cell phones should not be able to be used while in control of a car. There are many reasons and evidence to support my statement. Across the country there are laws that are being made about the dangers of the use of the cell phone. The reasoning is that when you are in use of the cell phone while driving it significantly increases your chance of getting into an accident. Car accidents are the leading death of teenagers these days because they are too distracted looking at their phone, rather than paying attention to the road.\\n\\nNearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Texting and driving delays your reaction time as much as driving under the influence of alcohol. There are many other opportunities for you to be able to get in touch with someone if it is urgent. There is new technology that has been created such as handsfree technology. There is Bluetooth, that will connect your phone to your call to make hands free texts and calls, if needed.\\n\\nIf you get into a car wreck because of texting and driving, your insurance rate will increase. The increase depends on many factors. Insurers follow the Insurance Services Offices standard of increasing a premium by twenty to forty percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident. If you avoid texting and driving you will not have to worry about your insurance going up, but you also you will not have to worry about your life or anyone in the passenger seat of your car.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that you should not be able to use the cellphone while driving. There are many laws and reasons on why it should start being illegal everywhere. People just need to start thinking about their lives and the other people around them, when they start to make decisions. They should realize that there are consequence that come with our decisions.\\n\\n1                                    \",\n",

Driving is a skill that requires constant focus on the road and the others on the road with you. Carless or negligent driving doesn't just affect the person doing the act, it also effects everyone around the distracted driver.\\n\\nTexting and driving incidents are one of the most reported problems in the US right now. In 2013, 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes, about 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver and 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Distracted driving has had a huge impact on many young Impressionable drivers who are very prone to starting bad habits that may lead to accidents involving other drivers on the road. Phones should not be involved with driving because they are simply too distracting and there is clear evidence that supports it, many lives can be saved and avoid all the pointless pain and agony caused to the people involved.\\n\\nThere are laws set in place to protect us that make sure people aren't distracted while driving, and if they are there are consequences that could even result in the revocation of their licenses. I believe these laws benefit society as a whole. If we were to not have these laws, then the death rates in the US would sky-rocket past the limits they already are. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.\\n\\nWith a problem that is so avoidable I hope that people can come together and realize what texting and driving is doing to the world and that all we have to do is follow the law and stay focused while driving to not only protect ourselves, but all the innocents around us.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nHow many people die yearly from texting and driving?\\n\\nNearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of 4 accidents are caused in the united states by texting and driving.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to operate cell phone use while driving, it causes the driver to get distracted from the road and that could cause the driver to have an accident.\\n\\nHowever, some drivers may still respond to a text message and that is why many of the accidents occurs and most of the time this lead to a vehicle accident that could lead to death.\\n\\nDrivers need to understand how easily it is to take someone life or themselves.\\n\\nEveryday people are risking their lives due to the high rate of cell phone use while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nTherefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are a distraction to drivers while their on the road.\\n\\nBecause of their conversation they might get upset and this could lower their driving ability that can lead them to lose control over the car.\\n\\nIf people don't make the right decision and put their cell phone away while driving their routine could harm innocent people.\\n\\nSome people may feel uncomfortable without their cell phone mainly because they are so use to having their cell phone in hand while driving. On the other hand there are disadvantages of using cell phones, they can easily get lost. Talking on cell phones are very expensive.

Drivers shouldn't use phones, because drivers hands-free technology is easy to use and is widely available, drivers should take passengers into consideration and having your phone in your hand slows down people's reaction time. These reasons don't allow drivers to keep themselves or others safe.\\n\\nDrivers shouldn't be using phones while driving, because hands-free technology is easy to use and is available to all. A lot of car brands use technology that connects people's phones to the vehicle's stereo system. In older vehicles models people can use bluetooth technology that allows people to use their phones hands free. By using this technology people are less distracted and more focused on driving. This can allow drivers to avoid accidents or life threatening events.\\n\\nThose who drive vehicles should consider their passengers and not use phones. Having passengers is a serious responsibility and using phones can put them at risk of being involved in an accident. Many deaths are caused by drivers using their cell phones. Using phones can risk the lives of pedestrians if drivers are not careful or paying attention.\\n\\nDrivers also decrease their chances of reacting to certain situations while driving if their attention is on their phone. People are more likely to get involved in accidents, because their reactions will be too late. Drivers are also likely to miss flashing lights and risk their safety to maintain a safe position in a driving lane. Using phones also cause drivers to slow down on speed and cause accidents with those going on a constant speed.\\n\\nDrivers or anyone learning to operate a vehicle should not be able to use their phones. Using phones can cause serious injuries to themselves and others around them. By using updated technology and avoiding phones, drivers can drive safely and keep other drivers and passengers safe as well 1            \",\n",
       " \"Texting and Driving\\n\\nToday, there are many strict rules about using your device for whatever reason and driving at the same time. I believe that you should not be able to use your phone while you are driving. When you are driving your full attention should be on the road, or things can go bad very fast. It only takes a split second of not paying attention to crash and get into a critical car crash. The laws of texting and driving are firm where they are.\\n\\nPeople who text and drive are usually the ones who get into fatal car crashes. If your full attention is on the road and your surroundings, there should not be a problem on the road regardless of any distractions. When you text and drive you are usually texting very quickly and lose track of the road and can end up on another lane or the opposite lane. When you drive you should put your phone down so you can focus on the road and your surroundings. If the message is important, you can call the person and still focus on the road so your eyes won't go from the road to you screen every second.\\n\\nWhen teen's usually turn 17 they start to drive, and usually teens are driving fast. If you are already driving fast, you most certainly cannot drive fast, and use your phone. You will not be able to concentrate on the road as well as using your phone to text and drive. Also, if adults are using their phone and driving, that sets an example to the younger generation and they might do it as well if they see their parents do it. New drivers will have a very hard time staying in their lane and having full control on the wheel if they constantly use their cellular device and keep on looking back and forth from their screen to the road. This can obviously lead to a fatal car accident, and is life threatening       \",\n",
       " \"Driving and Cell Phone Usage\\n\\nJust say you were stopped at a red light. You were minding your own business listening to Luke Combs new album and BAM. Someone behind you was on their phone and they didn't realize that there was a red light. If he would have not picked up his cell phone your car wouldn't have been rear-ended, but instead your going to need a new bumper and you pray that he has insurance. Cell phone can be a very dangerous thing while blowing DUI accidents out of the park. Some say that drinking and driving is more dangerous but let these facts tell you otherwise.\\n\\nEven though phones are said to be used during emergencies only driving down a two-lane road on snapchat is not an emergency. Texting and driving has 6 times the accident rate than drinking and driving. There is at least one death everyday due to cell phones, you could be next if your using your cell phone. That risk becomes 4 times greater just by picking your phone up. Another reason not to pick up your phone if you were to get in an accident and survive your insurance cost will drastically go up. It doesn't even have to be your phone just reaching for any object in your car increases your risk by 8.8%.\\n\\n1/3 of all car crash fatalities are due to mobile phones, not just texting or changing a song, but any cell phone related activity. You can look down for 1 second, but people lack the necessary reaction time to be able to look up and react to a pedestrian or a car running a red light. One way to prevent all this tragedy is to use some kind of Bluetooth device where you are using your phone hands free and you can pay attention to the road and surroundings. Using headphones are any of the such are still illegal in multiple states including Georgia. 88% of American drivers will use their phone on a road trip. While using headphones in Georgia is illegal the use of a hands-free device is legal. If it does not involve your hands being used, then you are allowed to use them. For example, blue tooth devise is highly recommended.\\n\\nWe need ways to prevent the usage of a cellular device while out on the road a great way to do this is; to keep your phone out of reach. Put it in your trunk or even in a glove box so you are not tempted to grab it. Keep your phone on silent or shut your phone completely off so you will not be distracted by an incoming call or message. There are special apps you can download on your phone that will allow all incoming messages to be blocked and on hold until you reach a point to where you can answer, only is the car is stopped and put into park. Every one in five people text and drive. This is no doubt ably the reason the rick factor is so high.\\n\\nSo, when your out driving and your mom calls to see where you are or if your okay make sure your phone will not hinder you from driving. You need both hands and eyes to drive. If you don't pay attention and you encounter a pedestrian walking, you might not be able to get out of the way in time. Accidents do happen and they happen many times a day. While so many people disobey the law, you can be that person who obeys the law and save someone's life by paying attention to your surroundings. People are always crowded you never know when some guy playing on his phone could jump out in front of you.    \",\n",
       " \"The Problem of Distracted Driving\\n\\nBeing on the phone while driving has become a nationwide problem. This problem is due to the increase of the relationship between phone and man. Humans have become more in tuned with their phones rather than paying attention to what is happening in front of them. The cell phone makes the driver lose focus of the road causing many problems. People should not be allowed to use the phone while driving because lives are being loss while people are texting and driving and it is dangerous for everyone on the road. There are two main solutions for preventing using the phone while driving which are either having more police patrol units out to help monitor the roads or having the person set up a self-control system for themselves.\\n\\nThe first prevention method is to have more police patrolling the roads as a way of moderating cell phone usage while people are driving. When people see the police, there is an instant nervous feeling that follows. Instilling fear of tickets or even the idea of going to jail within the people could help control the problem of cell phones and driving. If people see that police are watching, they will instantly do the right thing. Police patrolling can help decrease the numbers of distracted drivers on the road, ensure the safety of the drivers themselves and the people around them.\\n\\nSetting up units around the road could not only help with distracted driving but also help with situations that put others at risk while being on the road.\\n\\nThese patrol units could be of benefit for numerous problems but distracted driving being the most important. Although it is not an immediate reform to the problem, it is a start for correction.\\n\\nThe final prevention method is to have the people set up self-control systems that not only will ensure the safety of themselves, but the people around them. There are many different systems that can be put in place. One of the first things the driver could do is turn the phone off completely. This will ensure that there is no way the person can use the phone or react to any incoming notifications. If a person is not comfortable with the phone being completely off, then having the phone on silent is the next recommended response to be performed. This can help the driver focus more on the road because the sound of the phone's notifications are not distracting. This is not as effective as turning off the phone because depending on the location of the phone, the driver may be able to see the phone screen light up. If this occurs then the driver can be distracted. The most recommended self-control system is to have the phone completely turned off because it is fully assured that the phone will not be aiding in the problem of distracted driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. Driving while distracted is a safety problem that can be corrected. One way of correcting distracted driving with cell phones is to have police units set up on the road watching for any signs of cell phone usage during driving. These police units can ensure the safety of drivers on the road and even pedestrians. There is also the method of drivers setting up their own self-control system. These systems allow for the driver to be responsible for his or her own actions that help with the reforms of distracted driving. The two systems are turning the phone off or having the phone on silent. Turning the phone off is a secure solution for distracted driving because the driver will not have any interaction with the phone. Silencing the phone is the next recommended solution because this allows for the diver to concentrate on the road with a clear mind. These solutions to the problem of distracted driving may not be immediate, but they are a start to helping decrease the dangers that are triggered when distracted driving occurs.    \",\n",

Trying to conduct a vehicle can be difficult for some and easier for others and it's understandable but those who have no knowledge on how to drive still can cause car accidents caused by lack of focus when driving which is why most federal laws were created to prevent phone usage while conducting any motor vehicle and have been since enforced by police officers to keep others and ourselves safe from any possibly dangerous car accidents and fatalities.\\n\\nCellular devices were manufactured for fast, reliable, and strong communication to help us react fast if there were to be trouble or we were put in Harm way. Many situations may call us to get help as quickly as possible and there for cellular devices are there to call emergency services .

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell Phones have become a more modern technology which is why people have become more comfortable using them while driving. It is distraction that could end up being fatal. Not only are car accidents a result of using a cellphone while driving,but it also can cause road rage from other drivers,and traffic jams. People believe that they can multitask but truly the brain switch from one task to another which is not really multitasking. Cell phones should be banned while driving for a couple of different reasons. There are a lot of dangers when it comes to using a phone while driving.\\n\\nWhile driving you should never look away from the road. It is one of the most important factors when driving. Not only are you putting yourself in danger,but also the lives of other drivers and pedestrians. Texting while driving is one of the leading causes of death to people age 16-25. If you are texting your eyes are not on the road and your hands are not on the steering wheel. There a lot of different distractions such as smoking,eating,looking in the mirror,talking,and loud music. That could cause a car accident. But texting while driving has made its way to the top of the list.\\n\\nMost people believe that hands-free electronics are not a distraction and don\\'t pose danger to drivers but they actually do. Whether a person is texting or just talking, they are not focused on the road and this slows their reaction time. People think that if they are just talking and listening, with eyes still on the road, not taking them off, that they are just as alert as a driver not talking on a cell phone. But that is not the case a study showed that \"In 2001, they found that even hands-free cell phone use distracted drivers. In 2003, they revealed a reason: Drivers look but do not see, because they are distracted by the conversation. The scientists also found previously that chatty motorists are less adept than drunken drivers with blood alcohol levels exceeding 0.08. (Britt)\". Which provides evidence that drivers using a hands-free device are just as distracted as one who is texting.\\n\\nIn conclusion the cons of this argument outweight the pros. No life is worth a quick look at a cellphone. So due to the information provided cellphones as well as hands-free devices should be banned while behind the wheel of any type of vehicle.\\n\\n[Last Name] 2                        ',\n",

Texting should not ever be the main priority in a person\\x92s life and there are a number of instances where the person should put their phone down and wait for the proper moment to send that all important text to a friend. Once a person gets used to texting while driving, there is no telling where it will stop. One of the biggest problems with the technological advances that are being made is that it is turning people who used to be thoughtful and caring about the world around them into zombies. When you are constantly staring into a phone, you are bound to miss out on the little things in life.\\n\\nTexting while driving does not encourage a person to care about their surroundings and fosters a sense of detachment from the world at large. Constantly waiting for that next text to come rolling in is no way to live.\\n\\nLife is not always entertaining. But with the advent of smart phones, people are now discovering way to keep themselves amused constantly, which is not healthy. There are moments in life that are sad, boring or simply indifferent.

Its so sad to think that you could lose your life at any moment while being in a car just riding down the road and get hit by someone that is on their phone while they are driving. If you are in the car with someone and they are on their phone, ask them to put it down... save a life or even your own life.\\n\\nIt\\'s so sad to know that there are people out there that are that selfish to be on their phone while they are driving and not fully understand the consequences of it. The law enforcement here these last couple of years have really buckled down on the no phone while operating a vehicle law. They have just recently passed a law that you cant even have your phone on person while driving. If you get pulled over and you have it anywhere around you, you can get a big ticket. It\\'s not even worth it in my opinion, the text or call can wait.\\n\\nThe newer vehicles are making them now where you can connect them through Bluetooth on your phone and send messages and calls through just saying it over the speaker. I have an older model Malibu, and it doesn\\'t have all of the fantsy stuff but it does have Bluetooth and \"ONstar\" which is where you can call and talk over the phone instead of being on your phone. So many people I know have been in wrecks and the cause of it are phones. Phones are addicting and I want to be on mine all the time, but I know when I\\'m driving I don\\'t need to be on mine because I can barely focus on the road much less my phone and the road.\\n\\nMy down the line cousin got in a wreck and killed someone for a couple of reasons, one being the cause of having the phone up to his hear. This young girl was coming back from college in Cartersville, and my cousin was driving coming back from his friends house and he wasn\\'t paying attention to see the girl coming and pulled out right in front of her, and killed her. They saw that one of the causes was because of cell phone use and other things that were in his system... and he got charged with vehicular homicide. Which is killing someone while driving. My cousin is not a killer at all but he was on the phone while he was driving and killed someone from not having his full attention on the road.\\n\\nCars are really dangerous anyway, and hard to control sometimes, and adding a phone in that equation doesn\\'t make sense. Some people do drugs they are illegal, but it\\'s a matter of not caring, and being addicted. That\\'s kind of the same thing about the texting and driving. Some people just don\\'t care, and some just are too addicted to get off of it while they are driving. I\\'m not saying I am a perfect angel myself because I have been on my phone while I\\'ve been driving before but I don\\'t do it often, because I know what it can do and cause, and that\\'s not what I want at all.

Many believe that we can multitask but according to nsc. org that is a myth. Our brain does not have the ability to multitask instead \" the brain handles tasks sequentially, switching between one task and another. Brains can juggle tasks very rapidly, which leads us to erroneously believe we are doing two tasks at the same time. In reality, the brain is switching attention between tasks - performing only one task at a time.\"\\n\\nThere are other ways that you can void out using your phone and driving but buying things like bluetooths. You can talk on the phone without tampering anything or taking your eyes off the roads. Cars has also been more modernized to help fight this problem for example according to huffingtonpost. com \"Ford\\'s SYNC operating system, for example, sends texts dictated by the driver and reads incoming texts aloud; its MyKey feature allows parents to block calls and texts when teens are driving. GM is reportedly developing eye-tracking technology that can detect when drivers glance away at a text. Earlier this year, BMW unveiled plans for gesture controls that will allow drivers to point at the vehicle\\'s navigation screen to take a call.\" Even phones are being update as to where you can text and navigate through your phone while not looking and being on it. These adjustments are not being made for nothing. Take advantage because using your phone while driving is not dangerous to only someone else but to you as well!\\n\\nIn Conclusion we should not be allowed to use our phones while being behind the road no matter what we\\'re doing.

Typing text messages shortens a driver's ability to direct attention to the road, and react to traffic situations. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones while they are in their cars because they are not reliable. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices in your vehicle because you should give your full attention to what's around you. It's safer to use a hands free device so you won't have to reach for your phone, or connect a watch to your phone so all your texts and calls would come through.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of road fatalities will continue to increase. It is our responsibility to not incur other people's live because of one mistake that could impact someone else greatly.                                     \",\n",
       " 'The debate over whether or not drivers should be allowed to use their cellphones while behind the wheel has been a very popular topic throughout recent years. With factual evidence to support both claims, people seem to be pretty evenly split when it comes to which side of the debate that they support. I personally believe that when driving, drivers should NOT be allowed to use their cellphones in any way, shape, or form. Driving while distracted by you cellphone is too dangerous and causes too many injuries and casualties to be allowed.\\n\\nFirst of all, when you are driving and you have to perform all of your tasks for the phone manually, you are creating a distraction for yourself. This takes your attention away from the road and increases your chance of causing a wreck. According to the NSC, there are 1.6 million crashes and 390,000 injuries each year caused by cell phone usage while driving. This means that 390,000 of people\\'s \"loved-ones\" were injured in a crash caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nWhat if it was your \"loved-one\" that was about to become part of the statistic? What if it was you that was about to become part of the statistic?\\n\\nNow, you might be thinking \"Some cars now have the ability to connect the phone to the speakers via bluetooth, which gives the ability to talk on the phone while not being in contact.\" If you were thinking this, you would be right. This does indeed reduce the risks caused by holding the phone and doing everything \"hands-on.\" But, you are still going to be taking attention away from the road and putting it towards the phone when you give a command or you make a phone call. Also, not every car has this feature, therefore some people would get distracted trying to come up with a solution of how to talk on the phone without being in contact with the phone.\\n\\nWhat most people don\\'t realize is that the solution is right in front of their faces- \"Wait until you aren\\'t driving.\"\\n\\nLuckily, governments are realizing the dangers of distracted driving, as 20 U.S. states and territories have passed \"hands-free\" laws, which are laws that prohibit being in contact with your phone while driving. Even with this being in effect, there are still going to be people that will continue to text, make calls, and more while driving. There will still be injuries and deaths caused by distracted driving from cell phones. This is why I am a firm believer that the usage of a cell phone should be completely prohibited in any shape, form, or fashion while driving. It can wait.         ',\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nHaving phones while driving to some is safe, while others believe that it is may be dangerous. It is helpful to have a phone while driving because many people may need it for mapping instructions or directions to get from point A to B. It is also helpful because a lot of people may need their phone to communicate in case of emergencies. However, it may prove to be dangerous to allow teenagers or young adults to have phones while they are driving. This is a controversial topic that has lead to country-wise conversation.\\n\\nHaving phones while driving can be extremely helpful for people who need assistance while they are driving A large number of people need phone in order to use \"Google Maps\" or other forms of navigation. Especially people who are new to driving may depend heavily on the navigation systems. There are people out in the world who do not fully understand how the highways and other major speedways work. They will be forced to use the navigation systems to help them get to where they need to go. Even though this may pose a risk to people who are distracted easily. They may want to use their phones to do other things. However, people still need to know where they are going. Being able to get where people need to go is better than being stranded or having to pay for \"Ubers\" or other forms of public transportation.\\n\\nPhones also may be helpful to those who need their phones for emergencies on the road. No one knows or expects bad things to happen; so, in the event that a bad thing does happen people need to be able to make important phone calls to emergency services. If someone in the car suddenly has a heart attack, are they supposed to just drive faster and hope they make it to the hospital in time? Whoever is driving may need to call the police. Even if something bad does not happen in the car but it happens outside of the car. What if someone drives past a fire or they see a suspicious object on the side of the road; are they supposed to just assume that someone else will see it too? Phones may be dangerous but they are a necessity, whether it is on the road or in a vehicle.\\n\\nWhile having phones while driving may be helpful to those who need GPS services, it may also prove to be dangerous to teenagers who are new to driving. Teenagers of this generation have a habit of discovering new forms of technology; especially when it comes to social media. Students of high-school level or maybe even college may fall victim to the effects that driving while having a phone may provide. When a student is driving and using the GPS at the same time, the student may want to check notifications on a topic that they were interested in. Or they may try to text back a friend before they reach a stop light. Even if the student makes the choice to text at a red light, they may end up texting after the light is green while unaware of it. This may lead to a crash, especially if it is on a main road.\\n\\nHaving a phone while driving is a topic that deserves further conversation and discussion. Some argue that phones are a very useful tool, especially if it is being used for GPS purposes. Some also say that phones are useful in case of emergencies. While another group suggests that phones should not be allowed for the simple fact that it is a distraction. This topic is still under discussion and no end is in sight.   ',\n",
       " \"Cell phones have become an epidemic to drivers around the world. Statistics show individuals who drive while sending or reading text messages are 23 times more likely to get into a car accident . Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because of the attachment and addictiveness found in phone use. People for the use of cell phones while driving think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nThose opposed like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So, if people don't decide to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nHands free devices have been suggested to replace the risk of having your hands on a device while driving . Despite the suggestion , hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. Therefore , hands free devices wouldn't be a better alternative and would ultimately still lead to car accidents.\\n\\nOpposition say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.\\n\\nAll in all , if people don't give up cellphones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and other people lives.   \",\n",
       " 'Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis; drivers should be able to use cell phones in a restricted capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving.\\n\\nSome states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving.\\n\\nMy argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you.\\n\\nWhile my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner.      ',\n",
       " \"Should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Although some drivers argue that cellphones have become vital to our everyday lives, using them while driving can result in distracting the drivers attention which increases road safety concerns. Despite the fact that laws have been passed to restrict drivers from using phones while operating people still overlook them, and continue to put themselves and others at risk of accidents.\\n\\nUsing a phone while operating a vehicle is extremely distracting. Trust me I know from personal experiences of my own. One look away that you feel is just a second could end your life. Everyone has caught themselves at least once on the phone while driving. Studies have been shown drivers using cellphones always react slowly, and often make the wrong decisions. In other words cellphones decrease the performance of the driver.\\n\\nThe biggest argument against cellphones while driving is the security factor. Most people agree with the fact that during emergency situations cellphones can provide help. By making calls, getting weather and traffic information, reporting accidents, and even to locate their destinations. For this reason handsfree was invented to ensure that drivers do not have a phone in their hand while driving. Even though it might have seemed like a better idea at the time, studies have shown that even with a hands-free device it adds distraction to the driver.\\n\\nEvans 2\\n\\nLastly, let's talk about the laws and concerns they have . Several states, and countries have enacted laws banning the use of cellphones while driving. Also some of the concerns lawmakers have against the matter is all the deaths that came from this particular issue.\\n\\nApproximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel. Almost 390,000 injuries occur every year from accidents caused by texting while driving, and 1 out of 4 accidents in the US are caused by texting and driving.\\n\\nOverall phone use in any way or form while operating a vehicle is very dangerous and can result in the death of innocent people. In order to ensure that people are following the rules there should be more done within the law. Therefore if you ever find yourself in a situation think about the way it could end before you continue to move on.   \",\n",

Texting is one of the main distractions that cause these drives to kill and injure people. While texting you aren't focused on things that matter like the road and that causes these types of accidents to happen. People don't realize how serious this is, the driver might lose control of the car and their reaction time won't be fast enough. In 2011, accidents involving a distracted driver killed 3,331 people.\\n\\nHabits like texting and driving are important to break. An example of a simple solution to this problem is to simply turn off your phone, it will block out buzzers or vibrations that will tempt anyone to check their phone. Many states in the United States have already passed the no texting and driving law. People still believe that texting and driving is no big deal and have confidence they can text and drive simultaneously. However. Lots of teens spend 15% of their time not in their lane.\\n\\nWith the advanced technology we have today, we should be using voice activated responses and apps to tell people when someone is driving and they'll get to them shortly. Preventing texting and driving can be a simple problem to overcome but very difficult. But if everyone works hard to make it happen we could be saving many lives everyday. If the situation is so important to put someone else's life in danger then why drive at all? Because in reality one text or call could wreck it all.               \",\n",

The smartphone or mobile phone, many people think that it is not that dangerous but it is as dangerous as most things that can damage or hurt people just not as much. As it can hurt people in many ways the most severe way is to be in a car accident just by looking at a phone for even a second. Not only could that person hurt themself but whomever else is in the car or the person they have crashed into. If it is such a bad way to drive why don't people stop looking at their phones while driving?\\n\\nWell many people are worried about how their social status is doing and how their friend's day is rather than their safety. So even if the majority of people were to stop there would always be that other percent who don't care. Although drivers should not they would still need their phones for GPS. Many states already have this situation classified as illegal but some states do not. Even if they were to turn the sound some people may not know where 1/2 miles to turn is.\\n\\nThere are consequences to driving with a person on his or her phone but in some states they should not even if there should be. It should be illegal to drive using their phones. People who drive with phones should get a ticket and they should have to pay the fine or they would get jail time. Many people do not realise just how dangerous not looking at their surroundings are when driving a car. People have to worry about cars coming or going or when they have to stop, go or even yield.\\n\\nIt is known that when drivers get on the road there is a risk of crashing by the car or the person's actions so why make that percentage higher. Also risk not only themselves but other people.\\n\\nIt is just not right and not fair for other people they could have potentially hurt or damage their possessions.\\n\\nCell Phones carry A lot of information like the weather or the news and mainly social media. What someone is doing or how they are doing are important to their friends. Many people would agree that these reasons cause them to look at their cell phones\\n\\nAnd would convince other people to stop or text them before they drive to say that they are not going to be responding while they drive.\\n\\nMany people drive while using their cellular devices and it causes problems for many people. It is illegal in some states and some in not but even in the illegal states people still do it knowing they could cause damage to someone or themselves or even pay a fine. It should be illegal anywhere so people can think about whether or not they want to get a ticket. People should stop to think that they may make someone's day worse. People should just stop using their phones while driving in general but not everyone chooses to do it.            \",\n",

Cell phones started to become a problem when people were just looking down at their phones while crossing the street. Something that could be fixed. Now, people are choosing to use their phones while driving which has become an issue and is very dangerous. Which puts not only the driver in danger put others as well.\\n\\nEach day people are dying or being injured from using their cellular devices while being behind the wheel.

It\\'s more common for teens and young adults to text and drive (ages 18-24). 14% of fatal crashes are involved from texting and driving in this age division.\\n\\nIn 2017 the \"Hands Free Law\" had been issued.

Although they are a great technological advancement, if not used properly they can become a distraction and have deadly consequences. We are about to discuss some of the reasons why cell phones and driving should not be used together.\\n\\nSome people question... Why does my phone have GPS navigation yet I shouldn\\'t use it while driving? And it is simple. When your eyes leave the road, even for a second, it becomes careless and dangerous. Most cars are now equipped with Bluetooth navigation. So anything you need while driving is at your fingertips. If need be, plan ahead and adjust your phone settings before pulling off.\\n\\nA lot of younger people are losing their lives due to texting while driving. This too, can wait. If you need to send or respond to a text message then pull over. It\\'s very, very dangerous to try to send a text, or read one, while driving. Not only that, but it is also against the law.\\n\\nIt is understandable that some point in time while driving, everyone will get an \"important\" phone call that can\\'t wait. In this case, hopefully, you have already installed a hands-free device. If not, please pull over to take the call. It could mean life or death and no call, to me, is that important. Investing in Bluetooth or other hands-free devices will completely be worth it.\\n\\nAll in all, any type of distracted driving can be fatal. It is always best to avoid distractions such as, eating, music, texting, makeup, Etc all together. If you just can\\'t avoid your phone while driving, turn it off completely. You can always return calls and texts later and besides no one wants to get pulled over and get a ticket for something so easily avoided.   ',\n",

Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster. Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle.\\n\\nPrimarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone. However, it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.\\n\\nFurthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life.

       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nCell phones, we all have them, and they have become a necessity of daily life. This innocuous invention is close to cars in how much we now rely on them. There isn't any problem with this, but, these two great inventions are known for being dangerous to use together, leading to death for many. While cars already have many things to distract oneself with, from stereo to air conditioning to seat adjustment, cell phones have been the only thing to get so much attention for distracting drivers. The question is whether drivers can safely use phones while driving, the usefulness of cell phones in cars, and who usually uses their phone while driving.\\n\\nTo start with, drivers can safely use phones in cars, with a few caveats. First off, eyes should be kept on the road, so if you can use a phone hands-free, more power to you. Obviously, this excludes things like texting or video chat from being used, but voice calls need no such limitation. Since voice calls aren't really much different from talking to somebody else in the car, except you don't ever swivel to look at them. Then there is GPS, which can be used, but the destination and settings should only be changed while stopped, so there is no danger to oneself or others. Ultimately phones are safe to use in cars, as long as you remain conscious of yourself and your surroundings.\\n\\nCell phones are useful for so many things, such as GPS, communication, or simple entertainment. You might carry out a meeting over the phone, or find the directions to a hole in the wall restaurant. Phones can also be used in emergency situations to notify others of your location. Phones definitely have a lot of use to someone in a car, and they are fine to use.\\n\\nNormally young people are most credited with using phones while driving, and while this is technically true, some thought is necessary. While young people have grown up using technology, and are much more used to using their cell phones, they have also been inundated with messages about texting and driving throughout their childhood. A fairly common occurrence, however, is that people relax their caution while tired or otherwise influenced. Just by eliminating regular distracting situations, chances of crash reduce dramatically.\\n\\nWhen the right precautions are put into place, such as not texting and only using GPS while stopped, using the phone while driving is not too dangerous. Ultimately, it becomes the individual responsibility of people to stay safe while driving.         \",\n",
       " \"Should cell phones be used in the car?\\n\\nTexting and driving accounts for over half of all accidents that happen in the United States today. Phones are a major distraction in the world today, mainly in cars. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in cars while they're driving. When people call in their cars they can cause harm to themselves and others. Here are the reasons why drivers should not be able to make calls in their cars.\\n\\nThe first reason why drivers shouldn't be able to use a cell phone in their cars is that it causes a distraction for the drivers. Cars are a big machine used to move people from place to place. Cars are difficult to use by themselves, with all the signs and the radio in the cars, they don't need any more distractions to cause an accident. In a chart reviewing car accident causes from 1990-1998, it shows a quarter of the deaths in the U.S. were from distracted driving. That number has risen since people have started to make calls in their cars. Distraction is the first reason why people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones in their cars.\\n\\nThe second reason that people shouldn't make calls in their cars is that it's very dangerous. Drivers should have their eyes on the road at all times. If drivers have to look down to type in a phone number then they could get into an accident if they are not careful. Drivers could cause harm to themselves and others if they are looking at their phone trying to talk to a friend. The dangers of calling while driving out ways the benefits.\\n\\nThe third and final reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones in their cars is because of texting and driving. Most of teen deaths in the United States is car related. A lot of people die from texting and driving each year. Looking down at a cell phone and taking your eyes off the road is very dangerous. Using your cell phone while driving should be outlawed.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using a cell phone while you are driving is not safe. First, using a phone while driving is a huge distraction to the user.

       " \"Cell Phone Usage While Driving\\n\\nUsing a cellular device while driving should be strictly prohibited while driving, not only for the driver's safety, but also for the people around them. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and driving. The use of a cell phone or electronic device while driving is something that people do constantly without even thinking twice of the horror that can come from it. Even if you are only checking to look at a quick message so much can happen in the ten seconds the driver is distracted by their device.\\n\\nWhen texting and driving comes up as a topic everyone knows you should not do it, however, some do not understand the seriousness and harsh reality of the matter. Each year more and more lives are lost due to carelessness and irrational driving. Many studies show that texting while driving distracts the driver and affects their driving skills. Many think it just one harmless text but it causes injury, takes lives and, destroys families. You will not only ruin the people's lives around you, but ruin your life also because if any death occur you could be charged with vehicular homicide. At least nine people are killed every day because a distracted driver. More than one thousand people are injured everyday due to a distracted driver. Is the risk of your life and others really worth that one text message?\\n\\nImagine driving down the road on the way to a party with friends in the car with you, and you get a message from one of your friends that is supposed to be meeting you at the party. Instead of waiting until you get to the party, pulling over or waiting until you are at a complete stop you check the message. When you check the message and begin replying the music is up so loud that you could not hear your friends yelling that you have swerved into another lane. When you finally do notice what is happening you have already slammed smack into another car. Fast forward, you wake up handcuffed to a hospital bed and you are confused and can't remember anything but the fact that you were in a crash. You can barely move and you see your parents crying over you. When you are aware of where you are they tell you that you are the only one who survived the crash. You now know that you have been the cause of four deaths plus the person you crashed into is injured badly. Now you will be going to court and charged with several accounts of vehicular homicide. Now think if that one text that costed several people their lives and now you your life in prison was really worth it.\\n\\nTexting while driving when operating a motor vehicle is something that has become too common in this age. Texting while driving is more than a distraction, a fine , a license suspension, and a rise in insurance rates , it is life and death. Just five seconds of operating a device while driving can ruin you forever. No matter how many laws made people will still use their phones and put others at risk. Just think would you like to be a part of the statistic of texting while driving?            \",\n",

That's why I think cell phones should be banned from driving.\\n\\nHowever using a cell phone while driving should be illegal because you should be aware of yourself and the people around you. For example, if you get a text message from someone you can't pay attention to the road and to your phone. You can put many people lives under risk.

Some people may think they can text while they are driving and not think that it is very dangerous. However, people have to learn from their own mistakes for them to learn.\\n\\nInnocent people lives are being taken because of someone else mistakes. People don't seem to notice how careless they could be while their driving. You don't necessarily have to be texting someone. For example you could be taking pictures, doing something to your radio, watching a video, etc. That's why I think using cell phones while driving should be against the law.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting while driving is one of the biggest problems in the world. I think people should leave their phone alone while driving. However, you should pay more attention to driving instead of being on your phone. Where I live it is a 50 dollar law. That's why I think it should become a law all over the United States.      \",\n",

Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe and you can hurt not just yourself but other people as well. So many deaths have occurred because people have texted while driving a vehicle and they hurt people or even cause a death because they were paying attention to their phone instead of paying attention to the road.

Teens should not be able to use their phones while driving or even operate a vehicle if they know they are going to look at their phone at some point. Some teens will tell you that they know how to drive while using their phone at the same time or they would probably even tell you that they have been looking at their phone while driving for so long that they have not been in an accident, but even if that is the case those teens should not be able to drive because as stated so many times now, it is unsafe to text/ look at your phone while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe.

So that\\'s the reason you shouldn\\'t text while driving.\\n\\nYou also shouldn\\'t text and drive. There are 27,000 wrecks a day and most are from texting and driving. Like its crazy people don\\'t understand your putting lives in danger including yourself. How can we as people to get the unfocused people to understand that this activity their doing is dangerous and serious. Like I really hope people come to their senses and realize their live and everybody else are important. Remember people you\\'re live is more important than material things.\\n\\nI really think we need to get this through people head. Because last year 36,750 died from car wrecks like do they want to be added to the count. They need to come to their senses and ask there selves \"is it really worth it\", because what\\'s more important your life or a text. You should also fasten your seatbelt when driving or riding in a car. Because in 2017 6 out of 10 occupants have died in car wrecks for not having their seatbelts fasten. So if you were to have your seatbelt off and text and drive it\\'s a possibility you could get hurt very bad or die.\\n\\nSo now that I\\'ve explained the consequences of this activity that should stop. I want you to think about the actions you do have consequences so make better choices. So I hope you come to your senses and take notes on how to be safe in your vehicle. Stay focused and put your seat belt on, because you wouldn\\'t want to risk it all over something crazy.                  ',\n",

Cell phones have become a key part of people's lives today.\\n\\nUnfortunately, while people are driving they are choosing the wrong time to be using their phones. People today are so focused on their phones they are risking their lives and other people's lives. We are required to focus as much on the road as possible. If people would drive without being on the phone less people will be harmed. If you need to handle something important on the phone you should pool over on the side. This will probably cause less car crashing and less people getting hurt. You can even cause an accident by just checking your phone for a quick second. A second is all you need to cause an accident. You are putting yourself and others in harmful situations.\\n\\nAs you can see driving while texting is very bad. It can cause a lot of damage to you and the other person in the other car. As you are looking at the effect and damage that phones and driving cause. We should improve it. To where people are not getting harmed on the road. When we pick up the phone we should think about the lives that will be lost. When you are driving your car for now let's try to make a goal to focus on the road.

Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.\\n\\nTo start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.\\n\\nUsing your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.\\n\\nFinally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.\\n\\nThat person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone.

       " 'Should drivers be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle?\\n\\nThe age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death.\\n\\nTo begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law.\\n\\nThese drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver\\'s fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death.\\n\\nMoreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to \"1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.\" (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving).\\n\\nNot only are these wrecks traumatic to everyone involved, they effect the loved ones of those who got injured or died.\\n\\nWith such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it.\\n\\nWhile managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Looking somewhere else other than the road is just another second that the driver is not looking at oncoming traffic or pedestrians.\\n\\nTo conclude, a driver should not be allowed to use a cellular device while managing or operating a moving vehicle due to the risk of harming themselves as well as others, and the fact that it is illegal today and everyday following. Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.                ',\n",
       " 'Driving While Using Cell Phones\\n\\nMany people take chances and put other people\\'s lives in danger by using their cellphones while driving. Numerous deaths and injuries occur from those driving and using cell phones simultaneously. Using cellphones while driving causes needless accidents. It is almost impossible to efficiently multitask. The harm and effects of the accidents and deaths are far reaching. Drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving.\\n\\nSadly, numerous people are killed or injured annually due to accidents. Specifically, many deaths are caused by car accidents and the accidents are from teens and even grown individuals using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. In 2015, studies showed that about 72% of deaths were caused by accidents and about 44% of the accidents were caused because the teen was driving a motor vehicle while using their cellular device.\\n\\nFor many, driving is a daily activity, not requiring much thought or consideration. However, the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car crashes (Teen). Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices.\\n\\nIt has been proven that one cannot successfully multitask. While it might seem like you are accomplishing many things at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think we are. In fact, some researchers suggest that multitasking can actually reduce productivity by as much as 40 percent (Teen). This means that someone operating a motor vehicle cannot operate the vehicle and use their phone at the same time without an accident happening or losing concentration of the road while trying it. In 2019, 36% of respondents (aged 18-24) admitted to texting while driving. Of those who admitted to texting while driving, 51%. In 2019, an individual that was operating a motor vehicle and also on their cellular device at the same time lost control of the wheel and as they were losing control of the wheel spun out, causing them to merge over into a lake and died because of drowning (McCartt AT, Oesch NJ, Williams AF, and Powell TC). Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver\\'s awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes which proves why multitasking is nearly impossible to do successfully and why it should not be done while driving.\\n\\nThe effects of the accidents that drivers are causing are horrific because the effects that the accidents and deaths caused are far reaching. Drivers should not be using cellphones while driving because not only is it life threatening, but it also can be life changing. In 2016, there was an incident that happened when a car rammed into the back of another vehicle (2016). The person whose car was hit was rushed to the hospital immediately. This person was paralyzed for the rest of his life. This man now struggles with seeing his kids because he has problems with mobility which prevents him from doing regular everyday activities that we take for granted.\\n\\nIn closing, Cell phone use while driving has become the leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver\\'s risk of causing a crash. Driving with a cell phone could cause injury or death.\\n\\nIt has also been proven that an individual cannot successfully multitask while driving. Last, driving while using a cell phone harms others in ways that can permanently change their lives and affect the lives of their families.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\n\"2016 Fatal Motor Vehicle Crashes: Overview\" NHTSA.\\n\\nMcCartt AT, Oesch NJ, Williams AF, and Powell TC.

A lot of drivers like to text and talk on the phone, but mostly text when they are at a red light or even text while they are in motion driving. Driving with phones in hands can cause accidents like crashing into another car, running off the road causing damage to the driver and any other passengers in the car if any and injuring other drivers on the road and even causing death upon yourself. Some people are addicted to their phones and want to be on their phone every time they get a chance.\\n\\nTexting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post take eyes and brains off the task of driving. \" Usage of hands free device while driving\", \"Hands free is not risk free\".

Regardless of the crisis, people continue to use their phones while operating their vehicle because they want to always be accessible and keep in touch with other people. While some people aid using their phones while driving, there is documentation that they are dangerous and should avoid using them while behind the wheel.\\n\\nCandidates whose work revolve around using a cellular device, like lawyers an businessmen, say that they always have to available to answer the phone to keep their organization in tact. Nonetheless, because of their customs, they can create alarming and life threatening situations like an accident or collision. Business issues can be stressful and hazardous while driving because it can cause affecting reactions that can lead to misfortune. With that being said, if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones, their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nSome say that using a head-set while driving is a safer way to prevent people from getting into car accidents. Researches show that sing a headset can be dangerous as well as holding a cellular devices with your hand because the conversations still distract drivers from focusing on the road. People talking on the phone try to image the person that they are talking to. It is not that is interferes with their driving. It's more so the idea of the car swerving unexpectedly, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.\\n\\nCell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency, but people should not depend on cell phones fully because they are not always reliable.

The only reason why I think people need to follow this is because I've driven with people who have sat at the light because they were stuck on their phones and I had to tell them to drive so, to be honest, we need to limit ourselves to do it only when are stopped in traffic or we just parked up somewhere.\\n\\nI don't drive yet but everyone should just know this rule or just follow it at all times watch for police, police are like enemies they protect the streets and I respect them for that but honestly, they should always be avoided I'm not saying avoid them at any means necessary but just keep seat belts on and don't text and drive that's the easiest way a cop will catch you so make sure to get wherever you need to go and just move on try not to get in any trouble.\\n\\nAnd to conclude phones are really convenient devices that make millions of things easier for us day to day humans but we need to limit ourselves to just using it when not driving and only when it is really needed many cars nowadays come with their own little carphone technology that will speak to you and do stuff for you.\\n\\nApps like Waze make driving feel much safer and cars like teslas and the other cars I spoke about before can be great substitutes for phones while driving.       \",\n",

When will it end? Cellphones should not be used when driving.\\n\\nDid you know that texting and driving is more dangerous than driving under the influence? Studies show that using a cell phone to read or send text messages delays driver\\'s reaction time as much or more than the legal limit of alcohol consumption. Distracted driving has been called \"An epidemic in the U.S. that can be completely prevented\".\\n\\nI completely agree with them because texting and driving didn\\'t always used to be a problem.

It only takes three seconds after a driver\\'s attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur. All they had to do was turn their phone off or put it in the glove box of the car, And the potentially fatal crash could have been avoided.\\n\\nSo if your one of the 77% of adults that think they can text and drive your wrong. Things can take a literal turn for the worse in less than three seconds.\\n\\nAnd if your one of the 55% of teens that think that, just think you have your whole life ahead of you don\\'t ruin it over a Snapchat post, or don\\'t get one of your friends killed because you text and drive.

When they released they sprouted over the world making technology better. From 1999 to 2008 the fatalities from distracted driving increased. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System(FARS) studied trends in cell phone use and texting volume contributed to the alarming rise in car accidents. Phones are very useful in daily life,providing the internet,a sense of security, and communication between family and friends but can also be dangerous on the road.\\n\\nIn Fact,The National Safety Council that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Talking on a phone while driving is dangerous,period, and our to drivers is to simply don\\'t do it\",Jonathan Adkins. Distracted driving accidents are more common than you think roughly nine people are killed and more than 1000 injured daily in which at least one driver was distracted. Nearly 4000 were killed in crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015. In my opinion, i believed getting to your destination is more important than any text or phone call that can distract you from driving safely. One distraction can cause multiple lives including yours.\\n\\nIn Addition,it is illegal to \"physically hold or support, with any part of his or her body\"a \"wireless telecommunication\" or\\n\\n\"stand-alone electronic\" device while operating a vehicle. There are penalties for all distracted driving violations in Georgia. First offense is a maximum fine of $50, Second is a $100 dollar fine, and Third is a $150 dollar fine. There are negative impacts of using your cell phones while driving but it also benefits you in emergency situations. Most of the governments, including Austria. Australia,Germany, and different countries, have imposed restrictions on using cell phones during driving.\\n\\nFurthermore,Drivers tend to pay more attention to their phones when notified,therefore they increase the risk of fatal accidents. The main advantage to avoid using a cellphone during driving is ensuring safety of driver, vehicle, and other people driving on the road. Driver distractions play a role in 20-30% of all road collisions. In 2018, 2,841 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers. Cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the road making it unsafe for fellow drivers.\\n\\nIn Conclusion,Although cell phones can help you in many desired ways,it\\'s a threat to road safety.

Distracted driving is one of the leading causes of deaths on the highway. Cellphone use is comparable to driving under the influence,if not worse.

This is why the Hands-free law has been implicated. This is a great law that has began being implicated, the reason being that you can be stopped before an accident actually happens. It is also good because now people are more aware about their surroundings while driving.\\n\\nTheir have been many accidents a year that have lead to death and it is bad because these were countless lives taken for a very dumb mistake. This is a worldwide problem, like i said before, and it is becoming more and more dangerous for people to drive and walk around the crosswalk.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that i have sufficed the argument that phones are NOT fine to have, in usage, in a car. Hopefully this essay helped you understand that it isn't worth it. All the accidents and deaths over using a phone.   \",\n",
       " 'Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although it\\'s embarrassing to say, we have grown quite dependent on our phones. Due to this I believe we should be able to use our phones in some form or capacity while in vehicles. There are a multitude of reasons one may need to use their phone while in a car.\\n\\nOne reason they should be able to use their phones while in the car is for navigation. Many people only use their phones for the gps feature. A lot of people have a poor sense of direction or don\\'t know how to read maps. It\\'s also useful if one gets lost and needs help getting out of that situation.\\n\\nAnother reason they should be able to use their phones is in case of emergencies. One might need to alert the authorities for some reason. It could be an accident on the road where the police are needed. There may be a fire in need of firefighters or something along those lines. There\\'s no telling there might even be a need for animal protective services, these things happen.\\n\\nAlthough phones shouldnt be used for a lot of things while in the car, this shouldnt expel them from being used in all forms in the car. Accidents may very well happen because of \"text and drivers\", so maybe they shouldn\\'t text and drive. Completely banning cell phones though? That seems to be a stretch. Personally speaking I\\'ve lived in Georgia for two years and I still need the GPS to get around. Who has the time or patience to carry a map of georgia and pull it up to read it at every stop sign? The phones still can do alot of good while inside of vehicles. They can be used for emergencies. They can also be used for navigation. They even can just be used as a music player.   ',\n",
       " \"*BAM* A loud sound cracks across the intersection as if a bomb just went off but in reality, it was the sound of a SUV running into the back of a man on a scooter because the driver of the SUV was on their cellphone.\\n\\nBefore you decide to pick up a cellphone while you're operating a motor vehicle know the risks you're taking. Everyone in the car and in other vehicles are prone of getting hurt when a mind-altering device steers you away from the concentration you should have while driving. So many lives are taken or altered because of the simple decision to send or reply to one text message. If precautions are heavily enforced before adults and teens especially enter the car, then maybe this epidemic can become obsolete. Fines are enforced but how well is the question? Phones are the biggest distraction when you enter a car by far so this doesn't completely forget about alcohol or trying to change the radio station but technology has become so advanced that we have voice text and on a star. If the message is that important phones should become voice-activated and only respond to your voice so we can still pay attention to the road and send out a text without removing our hands from the wheel. Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all.\\n\\nEver since the emergence of cell phones, this generation has become heavily dependent on it for every minute of every day. Cell phones and texting were created ultimately to provide communication but it has now become so much more than that. The U.S. Government should ban texting while driving in all fifty states NO QUESTIONS ASKED! Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.\\n\\nPROPER_NAME \",\n",
       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nHmmm, should teenagers drive with cell phones? In my thoughts they shouldn\\'t because more and more people are dying because teens and their cell phone use. People should really consider what they do before the do it. They might end up regretting it in the end.\\n\\nOne reason a teen shouldn\\'t drive with phones is because they pay more attention to their phone than to the road. Over the past couple years 3,328 people were killed due to being distracted by their cell phone while driving. If teens just put their phone down and realize that life is more important than your phone, all of these deaths would decrease. I want people out there to think before they pick that phone up while driving. Is that phone call or text worth it?\\n\\nTeens don\\'t have much experience as an adult. Adult drivers are much more mature and advanced with driving. They could text and drive, but they have much more sense and consider the other drivers. Teens are quick to check their phones when they get a text. Use your brain for once and do not pick the phone up.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teens really shouldn\\'t drive and text. You may think that you are very experienced at driving but you\\'re not. Take the time out and think to yourself, \"Is my phone more important than your life or another person\\'s life.\" How would you feel if you killed somebody because you were texting and driving?                             ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nThe use of phones has grown tremendously to the point that people feel as if they can't survive without them. It's bad to know that our phones are becoming more and more of our lives and that people can't take their attention off of them for minutes while they are on the road. I personally don't think people should be able to use phones while driving because it delays everything as in the way people drive how they are at stop lights and all of that. Many bad things have come from people driving and texting so I dont think it should happen that people can excess phones while driving.\\n\\nThere are many delays when people are on their phones. If they drive you can pretty much tell if they are on them because, it will show they will sit at the stop light longer even after the light turns green and they drive slower. You have to remember to when you are driving like this it puts others at risk of kids if they are playing and you don't see them because you are on the phone it will put them at danger if you do something. A lot of drivers that do this don't think of it as a risk because it benefits them but it truly is because, its putting every one in danger including them because their attention is altered and the person in front of them may make a sudden change.\\n\\nI was looking at a document and it said that texting and driving is comparable to drinking under the influence if not worse and I could see that because when they are on the phone they swerve and slow down and their attention isn't on the road at all. People who are texting while driving are 23% more likely to crash their cars. This percentage is equivalent to that of the average person who has drunk four beers and then began to operate a car which is scary because, I am on the road pretty much everyday and to know that these people are out there too is terrible. If phones are worse than drinking I feel that it should be illegal to be on your phone while driving because, it is illegal to drink and drive so this should be too.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I don't agree with being on your phone while driving is right and it should be banned. A lot of bad outcomes can come from a person being on their phone. It's very sad to think about what could happen. People have kids and still drive with them for example my cousin does it and it's sad that she can put her selfish needs to the side for one minute to focus on the road so her and her baby can get to where they need to go safely. My mom always says I think about myself and others which is good because I always analyze everything for everyone and I want everyone to be good so if I need to get off my phone for a few mins for a safer drive I am fine with that.         \",\n",
       " \"I'm going to be talking about how phones can be used for. I'm going to talk about people driving. If it's okay to drive and use phones or it should not be a good idea. Phones and driving are good at times but not in the same time. Phones are good for emergency calls or for help.\\n\\nUsing a phone is dangers when driving. Someone can lose control of the car when driving. Someone can get hurt by using the phone while driving. Someone can lose site from the road because that person decided to use their phone. Using the phone can get that person stopped by the police.\\n\\nWhen using a phone while driving can cause an accident. Someone can run over a person for using a phone. Someone can hit a car while using a phone while driving. Someone uses a phone while driving and runs a red light and hit a car. Someone can run a stop sign and hits a kid.\\n\\nWhen driving and using a phone can get someone killed. Someone can fall off a cliff while driving and using a phone. Someone can flip over and lose their life while driving and using their phones. Someone can be going fast because they were using their phone and wasn't paying attention and hits a car and dies. Someone pays attention to their phone and runs over an animal and dies.\\n\\nTo conclude my essay driving while using a phone should not be allowed. Drivers should pay more attention on the road. Safe driver will not us a phone while driving. Reckless driver can cause an accident. People should not drive and text because someone can get hurt.        \",\n",
       " \"Phone And Driving\\n\\nThere are a lot of people that text while driving. Even though there is now a law that says you are not allowed to text while driving. There are probably a few people you know that still text while driving. It's not just texting either people also talk on the phone while driving as well. I do believe drivers should not be able to be on the phone while driving a vehicle. Also in 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use.\\n\\nSECTION HEADER\\n\\nThe zebra started a survey on people within the ages of 18-24 about texting while driving. Most of these respondents knew texting while driving was illegal. Would you believe me if I said that 36% of the respondents admitted to texting while driving. Out of the 36% of people who admitted it 51% of them admitted to being very aware that it was illegal. In 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to texting and driving.\\n\\nIn 2017 2,700 teens died do to drunk driving, even though that is still a lot over 10,000 teens have died due to texting while driving in the same year. When you are texting and driving you are 23 times more likely to get into an accident.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThere is no reason you should put your life at risk just to see a text. That one text could be the last thing you see. It's not even just your life at risk it's all the people on the road with you that lives are also at risk. Just think about it next time your driving and you get a text. Should you read it while driving. Think of all the lives your risking.\\n\\nWorks Cited https://www. thezebra. com/texting-and-driving-statistics/\\n\\nhttps://www. missourilawyers. com/blog/texting-and-driving-vs-drunk-driving/                                 \",\n",
       " 'I personally do not agree with the usage of a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle. Although some believe that a cellular device is perfectly fine to use while driving, They are far from right. It has resulted in many fatalities all across the nation and is illegal in some states. Using a cellular device while driving is not only a risk for your own well being, but those around you as well.\\n\\nIf you\\'re ever at a stop light and you look around, most likely somebody is on their phone. While driving you should have complete focus on the road at all times. A cellular device takes all of your focus off the road, now making you a distracted and therefore, a dangerous driver.\\n\\nMy Uncle used to operate his phone while driving, in result, one morning on his way to work, he was in a car accident. Thankfully nobody was hurt and the damage to his vehicle was reparable. You may think, that will never happen to me, well an accident can happen to anybody, any time, and anywhere. He could have seriously hurt himself or another person. Distracted driving is not a joke, and it should be taken seriously. When you get behind the wheel you are automatically putting your life along with the others in the car and on the road with you at risk. Do you want to be responsible for taking another person\\'s life, another human being like your or me?\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have an accident while sending a text. The other person may have been hurt or perhaps killed. You are at fault. If the accident resulted in death, you\\'re going to face jail time because that\\'s considered manslaughter. If you just hit them, you\\'re paying for their vehicle and medical bill, not to mention your insurance rate is going to skyrocket. Is all of that worth sending a quick text? Risking the lives of the men, women, and children around you and in your community?\\n\\nAllowing yourself to be a distracted driver not only shows your disregard for others but also shows the lack of self control you posses with technology. I believe cell phones have become an addiction. Many people can\\'t live without them and are constantly on them. Cell phones have become more and more convenient and connected to the world. It can sometimes be hard to accept the fact that it is not a necessity to have on at all times. There are plenty of excuses that people often use. But there is bluetooth in many newer model cars, and bluetooth headsets, which is still no excuse.\\n\\nSome excuses may be, my mom is sick, I was checking on a family member, I was calling into work, etc... Many people take advantage of those so called,\"excuses\". If you need to use the phone that badly, pull over and make the call. Don\\'t risk the lives of others to call your best friend and tell her about your day. Being a distracted driver isn\\'t okay and it isn\\'t cool. Using a cell phone while driving is illegal in the state of Georgia, yet people do it anyways. Nothing is more important than your own life, or others. So as a result, I do believe that using a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited by law.   ',\n",
       " \"Cellphones have become extremely popular in the 20 years. In many ways they are a very helpful devices that provide worldwide communication and interaction. Though, they have also caused trouble in several ways as well. One of said ways is the severe amount of people who are distracted by them while driving.\\n\\nAs phones innovate more and more overtime, so does the amount of people who use them. Phones themselves are not a bad thing, the problem is how people often use them. There are a lot of people who will make text and calls, or even watch videos on their phone while they are driving. Doing this pulls the focus away from driving and causes danger for those who are distracted, and their fellow drivers on the road. On countless occasions people have gotten into accidents and wrecks all because they wanted to text a friend. Often these wrecks are fatal. Something needs to change.\\n\\nPeople should not be able to continue driving like this, it isn't safe for anyone. Thankfully, more and more people are also realizing this anger will only grow if nothing is don't, so they helped to make changes. Here recently laws have been passed that make it illegal to be on your phone at all if you are driving a vehicle. Hopefully this will open more people's eyes to the severe danger we face every day without even realizing it.\\n\\nAs helpful as phones may be, people still manage to endanger themselves and others with them daily, and it will not cease until action is taken. Too many people have lost their lives to such a needless issue. And as often as it may happen people still continue doing it, thinking they are safe but anyone who does it is automatically in danger the moment they turn their phone on while behind the wheel.               \",\n",
       " \"Ever since the invention of the flip phone people have been texting and driving. This is an issue because well frankly it is dangerous. People who text and drive are more likely to cause a crash. Even if it is an emergency it still is not right to text and drive. In my opinion i do not think it is right to text and drive.\\n\\nPeople should never be allowed to text while driving because it can cause crashes and even kill bystanders. When a person is going 50 mph and you look down at your phone your traveling 150 feet without control. In the state of Georgia you can get a ticket and a fine up to 25$ first time offender and 150$ for every other time you are ticketed plus one point against their driving record(1). If a person who was texting and driving causes a crash they could be charged with murder if the passenger or driver of another car is killed.\\n\\nOn the other side, during an emergency it is not right to send a text but it can be omitted in extreme situations. If you absolutely need to send a text but it is not an emergency, just pull over and send it. You could even get your passenger (if your with someone) to send it and save a life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, texting while driving is bad because you can kill others and ruin people's lives. When your in an emergency you should pull over and send it so you do not get a ticket. You can be fined or even put in jail for breaking this law.\\n\\nWorks cited page\\n\\nURL https://www. drivinglaws. org/indexhf. php Website Titlewww. drivinglaws. org\\n\\nArticle Title Cell Phone and Texting Laws Date Published January 16, 2018\\n\\nDate Accessed June 05, 2019   \",\n",
       " \"Cell phones while driving\\n\\nCell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues that we have today. Everyone has a cell phone so more than likely it's in there hand 24/7, When it goes off while they are driving they automatically think that they have to check it right then and there no matter if it is a message, social media, or even a phone call. Cell phones while driving should be stopped for the safety of the people on the roads and even your own life. No matter if you can drive and be on the phone, think of the others that you are putting in danger.\\n\\nWhen you get notifications you have to look down for quite some time, It is dangerous to type and read while on the road so why put yourself and others life at risk. While you are reading or even texting you are putting all of your thought into the conversation that you are not focused on the road. You could be texting or looking at your phone and slowly losing control of the car which could easily cause a car crash that you could have avoided just by paying attention to the road.\\n\\nMaking phone calls while driving are dangerous as well. I understand that you could be busy and have important calls coming in or even going out, but they can truly wait until you come to a stop or even make it to your destination. There should be absolutely no reason to pick up or even have your phone in your hand whatsoever. If the call is really important then you can pull over from where you are and answer the phone at least try to think about others on the road\\n\\nA call or even a text can wait until you get to where you are going, ,cell phones should not be allowed while you are driving. Be aware of everyone's safety not just yours. Think of all the things that I just said and take them into consideration. Others may say that being on the phone while driving is not bad if you know what you are doing but why take a risk at something that you can avoid.\\n\\n2            \",\n",
       " 'Phones VS Driving\\n\\nNowadays, it is estimated that around 5 billion people around the world own a mobile device. That is a huge amount of people but to every pro there is a con so, a major problem has come into light from all these phones. One out of four car accidents in the United States Alone is caused by texting and driving. Many people believe drivers should not use cell phones during the operation of a motor vehicle but in my opinion, it is a necessary evil to a certain extent and you should proceed at your own risk. Let me elaborate on how I came up on this assumption.\\n\\nFirst of All, the x factor is phones have become such an important asset to our lives that most people got to stay connected some type of way. Whether you have to reply to a message from your best friend or you want to replay your favorite song, etc... Humans will always choose to pick up the phone no matter what. Laws and different measures have been taken throughout the world to stop people from picking up the phone but sadly, people still have accidents. Therefore, when laws and word of mouth does not stop this \"epidemic\", innovators step in and instead of trying to stop the act of using a phone during driving, they enhance the experience in a safer way.\\n\\nLike I was stating above innovators step in, let me build on that statement. Many companies seen the safety hazard and they came up with their own solution. For example, most cars from 2007 & up come with a hands free feature. You connect your smartphone to the car through Bluetooth or a USB and you don\\'t got to pick up the phone due to the fact you can do most of the activities that you do on the phone, on your car through a series of buttons and knobs, hence the name of the feature. In addition, many extra accessories have been created to help, not stop the use of smartphones but control it instead.\\n\\nLastly, no matter what the subject is whether its phones or something else, people are going to be people. What I mean by that is there will always be that # of people that just will not follow directions till an accident happens to them. I am a prime example of that, back then my dad would always tell me to put the phone down while I was driving, and I would be like \"yeah yeah\" sarcastically. Until finally one day I was driving home from school, and my favorite song played, so right after it ended I looked down for less than 10 seconds to replay it. Without noticing the car in front of me had stopped, I ended up rear ending her. It was nothing serious because I was going slow but still that little time I took to look at my phone could\\'ve cost me way more.\\n\\nIn my opinion, phones are an unavoidable problem nowadays. What I mean by that is yes they do cause accidents and they are a huge problem, but in this day and age almost everyone has a phone. Which makes the situation worsen due to the fact that we have become so accustomed to using our phones no matter the gravity of the situation.               ',\n",

       " 'Phones and driving\\n\\nAs times shift and humanity as a whole evolves it is evident that today in the present the vast majority of the population has some sort of possession and usage of cell phones . With that being said it should be noted that although cellphones are a crucial part of many individuals daily routine , there is a time where the safety of both drivers and pedestrians comes first .\\n\\nDue to that reason along with plenty more ,drivers should not be allowed the usage of cellphones while operating any sort of vehicle as it poses a threat to the driver and their community as a whole .\\n\\nThe most important reason why cellphones should be prohibited while driving is because of the hazards it poses to drivers . Reports show that one in four automobile accidents are due to texting while driving that in the past year alone is estimated one million and six hundred thousand accidents due to cell phones. Adding to the importance of this subject teensafe. com states that on the daily there is, about 9 fatal crashes due to distracted driving\\n\\n! All which could be prevented if individuals knew the prompt time to use their devices and if laws further enforced the hazards and prohibition of cellular devices while under the operation of a vehicle .\\n\\nNot only does distracted driving create a danger to the driver but also the surroundings of the driver which can be detrimental . Experts compare the use of a phone while driving to drinking while driving because of the amount of time the drivers eyes are off the road ,this can further visualize the threat a distracted driver can pose to pedestrians and other drivers . When texting while driving you are far more likely to be in an accident , be at fault for an accident both to another driver or pedestrian , and cause damage to community infrastructure. Also in psychological studies it has been proven that the human brain is not capable of functionally multitasking that along with how driving could already be a danger it simply does not result in anything positive over a simple distraction which could wait, something life cannot do .\\n\\nIn conclusion , as distracted driving becomes more and more common the hazards should be emphasized far more and the act alone should be prohibited . No good comes from the use of a phone while driving as doing so not only is the driver at high risk but so is all of their surroundings which includes other drivers and pedestrians. Distracted driving or texting while driving is the number one preventable cause of death in america that alone explains how big of a problem the use of cellphones and driving has become .Moving forward it is crucial for drivers to be engaged on the road and to know when the prompt time to use their cellphones is as it can be a distraction which could wait ,something in which life cannot do . The safety and well being of yourself and others is far more important than anything a phone can provide, solely for that reason the use of cell phones should be prohibited while operating any sort of vehicle\\n\\nWorks cited\\n\\n\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving.\" Edgarsnyder. com, www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html.\\n\\nTeendriveadmin. \"Texting and Driving Crashes Facts and Statistics.\" TeenSafe, 19 Feb. 2019, teensafe. com/texting-and-driving-crashes-facts-and-statistics/.\\n\\nHamilton, Jon. \"Think You\\'re Multitasking?

In this fast age of quick communication there is one boon that stands out of the crowd and yet is an implicit part of the crowd, the mobile phone. Although the mobile phone has been around for quite some time now, but it was not until the last decade that the fad of owning a mobile and the necessity of using one has come into force. While there is no doubt that the device is a wonderful means of wireless communication, it has an enigma attached to it, the enigma of using a mobile phone while driving. It is nowadays a common scene to see people using their mobile phones while driving, they text while at the wheel or talk to people while driving, this has lead to a scary situation on the whole. Since people using mobiles while driving not only puts them in danger but also the person they may happen to be in an accident with, it is a very grave situation to be taken into account. Every morning one can find a many articles related to road accidents that happened because someone was busy using their phone while driving. A lot of groups including the wireless communications industry and transportation safety groups have initiated educational campaigns that encourage the discreet use of mobiles while driving using the mobile while driving may result into some serious consequences for the drivers, collisions may result in minor to serious injuries and can sometimes prove to be deadly. Accidents result into damage to life and property not only for the one who is driving but also to the one happens to be in accident with the driver.   ',\n",
       " \"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.\\n\\nOpponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. In conclusion, I think that mobile phones are indispensable tools that we cannot live without, but we should avoid abusing them. Therefore, we should think carefully about the advantages and drawbacks before purchasing a mobile phone, and ask ourselves why we need a mobile phone and whether we will be able to use it responsibly.    \",\n",

While driving people can get distracted by their phone while looking at a video or a message that just got sent. While it can be tinting to grab the phone and grab that call or look at that message you should really just let it wait. And if you think that it's important you can make a stop at a gas station or a public place and take the call or read the message.\\n\\nBeing on the road is a privilege that should be used wisely. The reasons are that you are more likely to be in a car crash. This can be not only physically but mentally harmful to you and the other person involved. For example talking in the physical term you can have a brain injury, be in coma, have to have a body part cut off , or even die. Mentally you can have mental anguish, emotional distress, and sleep disturbance which are just some of the things that can happen after being involved in a crash.\\n\\nEven though this experience can be a disturbing thing in someone's life. There are also some reasons why a person should use their phone while driving. For example, if you really need to take a call at that moment, need to use gps, or if it's for a health emergency. Though these are some reasons there is no excuse for a person to put themselves and other people in danger. There are other solutions to not use a phone while driving. That can save your life and someone else's\\n\\nIn conclusion, it's not a great idea to drive and use your phone at the same time. Even though nothing happens to you while using, no one knows what's gonna happen the next day. That way it's better to prevent and stay safe. And not only think of yourself but others.   \",\n",
       " \"Yes, today most the people have cellphones anything technological. But should we be able to operate cellphones while driving is the question everyone is concerned about. Everyone has different set of ideas about if people should be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are lots of advertising about phones and the cool things that they can do. And that you can test without having to stop looking at the road but those are all false advertising because you do. You must unlock your phone for you to be able to say the text just because we don't have to type it doesn't mean that is don't take our sight off the road. Some say it's wrong for you to text and drive and they are right it's wrong to do it because something can happen to us or more likely to someone else. It's easy for us to think that nothing can never happen to use if we text and drive at the same time, because it may have never happened to you but it doesn't mean that it hasn't happened to anyone else. Drivers should be more careful about what they do when they are driving it should not be legal to text and drive. No one should have to lose a family member for someone who was texting and driving and not being careful. Some want to get home to their families and can see them again.\\n\\nEveryone has their own opinion and that fine, everyone has the rights. Texting and driving can cause your own life and someone's else for example A Fathers, mothers. Children's life. Cellphones are really use full to use and always will be useful. Because they help use in our everyday life to get to places talk to our families that don't live close to use. It helps use be able to work and have good jobs but it also hurts use not just that fact that lots of teens text when they drive but the fact that they can't be without their phones to be able to get safe where ever they are going. Inconclusion I think that it's wrong for anyone to text and drive you should play safe and just wait to answer a text message a call when you get to the place you need to be. Safe the fact that something can happen to you and your family will be upset and cry for you just because you couldn't wait to answer your phone.   \",\n",

However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and risky situation or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reaction. Because of they conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car.\\n\\nHowever, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.

They love the easy access of talking with loved ones, the taking of selfies at any time and the excitement of scrolling through and interacting with friends on social media. Cell phones have really made life for the American people a joyous and exciting occasion; until they get behind the wheel of a car. Loss of life, driving privileges taken away, and getting a ticket are all common problems that cell phones use when driving present.\\n\\nCausing an accident and killing yourself or another person is a very real situation you can face when using the cell phone and driving. There is nothing wrong with talking all day and night to family and friends on the cell phone. The problems come when you decide to take the phone conversation into the vehicle while driving. One of the problems is distracted driving and taking your eyes off the road. Taking your eyes off the road is dangerous because in a split second you can have an accident and kill yourself or another person.\\n\\nIf you get into a serious accident, you may lose your privilege to drive your vehicle. The common behavior of texting and driving is similar to a person that has been drinking and decides to drive a vehicle. This behavior is dangerous, reckless, and an accident waiting to happen. Your eyes are supposed to be focused and alert on the road; not in your phone. If you recieve multiple tickets for driving while using your phone, there is a chance that your driving privileges could be taken away. To get back the privileges to drive again could cost a lot of money and time. Being able to drive is a privilege and losing that privilege is not worth losing due to a social media status update.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia you are not allowed to text and drive, if you are caught texting while driving you will receive a ticket. People who text and drive are putting their lives and other people's lives at risk. In order to prevent the 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States from texting and driving, there must be more laws put in place. We must continue pushing the hands free law to save more lives and help keep the roads safe.\\n\\nAs of today, getting a ticket, risking the loss of driving privileges, and even taking a chance of causing a death has not stopped drivers from using their phones while driving. It is exciting to take the perfect selfie and update your social media status on the go, however those are some of the things that should not be done while driving. Distractions from using cell phones while driving have become very dangerous and caused our roads to be unsafe. In order to drive you must follow the driving rules and understand that tragic events can be caused by using cell phones and driving at the same time. So for the reasons I explained in this paper, I don't think individuals should be allowed to drive and use a cell phone in any state in america.                      \",\n",
       " \"Drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. In Georgia a hands free law was passed to prevent drivers from doing other things while driving. When drives are distracted they can put their life in danger as well as other people in the car or other people on the road. Drivers should take that into consideration when they are on the roads driving. Drivers should be 100% focused on the road and not concerned about other things such as phones.\\n\\nMost people can not focus while driving so it is very serious that drivers keep their eyes on the road. Texting and driving is like driving with your eyes clothes one little text can put your life in so much danger. Cars are made with bluetooth so that it lowers the chance of distracted drivers. Drivers should pay attention when they are driving such as drinking and driving. Kids are in the car with drivers when they don't know anything that goes on with drivers.\\n\\nWhen you get caught on your by a police officer you can be fined and lose your license. When you lose your license you would have to go through a long process of getting them back. You can also get points taken off your license risking the chance of you doing things as far as traveling and police will be strict on you. You can save many lives just by paying attention to the road because others sometimes don't pay attention.\\n\\nThis texting and driving can be very serious and dangerous. Your family would be sad if something bad happened to you causing you to not make it home all because of a text. With bluetooth cars you can talk to the car a drive its called hands free. You can text people back on the steering wheels its options for that so that it lowers the risk of you taking your eyes off the road. Making it home feels like a big accomplishment to some people.\\n\\nHigh Schoolers and younger kids should be required to take a class that teaches them more about the severity of texting and driving. Teens get cars and can't stay off their phones. They are more likely to be the ones to get in an accident. Teens could download a app while driving to preventing them from being on their phones while driving this app helps teens earn discounts on popular things that they want to purchase. Texting while driving should never be allowed!                                 \",\n",
       " \"Drivers and Cell Phones\\n\\nAlthough there's laws against it, people on the daily use their cellphones while driving. They'll check social media, text, call, and use its other functions. While it may seem like this doesn't uphold any problem or threat, this can be very distracting to not only the driver, but other drivers around them. However, some still think it's harmless, despite all the news stories and other tales of accidents while drivers were holding their cellphones.\\n\\nOne might argue that drivers using their cellphones aren't always dangerous, and that they most phones have voice command features and others like that which can allow the driver to use their phone without even touching it. And while this can be good way to use a phone while driving, the voice commands aren't always accurate and the driver might be tempted to fix any mistakes it makes before sending their message or going through with whatever they used the voice command for. In this case it makes using the voice command at all completely pointless. In other words, the phone would still be distracting to the driver.\\n\\nMost of the people who use their phones while driving are usually of a younger age, such as their teen years or early twenties. Since younger people are usually around their phones more often, it's easier for them to become distracted more easily by it, and in turn they could cause a car accident which could harm not only them, but the other people around them. All of this could be avoided if certain laws were put in place to prevent people even touching their phones while driving.\\n\\nWhile there can be ups and downs to having phones while driving, it's typically not a good idea. There have been countless tragedies related to cellphones while driving, most of which could have been prevented. It's one thing to have been holding a phone if it were a case of emergency, but that's usually not the case. People tend to disregard the safety laws regarding safety while driving, and it can be a danger to everyone involved, which is an issue that could be fixed by putting laws in place in order to keep drivers safe.         \",\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nTexting and driving is never okay but that doesn't mean that phones should never be used while driving. There are beneficial uses of cellphones that allow drivers to get to their destination is a faster, happier way. Technology keeps advancing and is even included in newer cars or other vehicles. Not everyone has, or can afford a new car though. This means that they must rely on their phone for music, GPS, and emergency phone calls.\\n\\nMusic can be a big deal for drivers because in certain kinds of situations such as long drives. Long, extended drives causes drivers to not be able to focus on where they're supposed to be going, also called highway hypnosis. Music allows drivers to focus better and keep them attentive. It also keeps drivers in a good mood which causes less stress and road rage.\\n\\nGPS is the most necessary reason for using a phone when the car doesn't have that kind of technology. GPS is safer than writing down directions or using a map. The driver doesn't have to look down at the phone either because most GPS services have a voice speaking out directions for them.\\n\\nSometimes drivers have absolute emergency phone calls that they must take. They don't have to put their phone up to their ear since there are other ways around it. Drivers could use the speaker option on their phone or Bluetooth. An emergency call could include calling the police for reckless drivers or crashes. Personal emergency calls include a wife going into labor or needing to take a detour to pick kids up from school.\\n\\nDrivers should never text and drive, however there are still plausible uses for phones such as getting directions from GPS, listening to music as entertainment, and emergency phone calls for various reasons. Most reasons for phones are unnecessary especially with the technology provided in newer cars. If the driver has a car that has everything available, then their phone is not needed in their presence.\\n\\nWilcox 2                                                                              \",\n",

People in the world today are glued and stuck to their cellular phones because of this world being technology driven. Cellular phones are now smart phones, literally walking computers.\\n\\nThat's wonderful in its place; however, putting your life and others lives in danger while using cellular phones while driving is the issue of today.\\n\\nThe numbers showing the danger of cellular phones used while driving a vehicle are very scary. In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their cellular phones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and 3,328 people were killed during the year of 2018 which was the most during 2018- 2020.\\n\\nA vehicle needs your undivided attention because you are not driving for yourself, you are driving for others. People get very distracted by things such as texts, calls, or even music. In my opinion, this generation cannot multitask so they put their mind on one thing and stick to that. This is usually the cellular phone and not the road while driving the vehicle.\\n\\nIn my conclusion, life is more important than a text or a Direct Message when driving a motor vehicle. We shouldn't just think about ourselves, but think about other drivers on the road, and help everyone get back home safe and sound to their loved ones.    \",\n",
       " \"Should drivers use their phones while driving\\n\\nShould drivers be able to use their phone in shape form or fashion? No because it's a distraction to anyone, no matter how skilled they are. It is a safety hazard for the people you share the road with and to yourself. The leading cause of a wreck is because of drivers are paying attention to their phones and not the road. One the other hand if there is an actual emergency and you need to answer it pull over as soon as possible.\\n\\nHow many times have you been in the car and you look around and see people using their phones while driving? A lot of times, am I correct? Of Course I am around about 10% of drivers use their phone while driving, during the holiday that number increase a whole 15%. About 26% of accidents are caused by people using their phones while being behind the wheel.\\n\\nIn the state of Georgia there is a law called the hands free law. Which states that driver a prohibited to have their cellular devices in their possession while driving. So with that being said that backes my argument up even more. And it isn't just Georgia there is so many other states that have it to. So we all know if the government has a law on it its a real problem. If caught breaking this law you can be written a ticket 50 dollars or more depending if its is your first offence or not.\\n\\nNow there are some moments when you just have to use your phone. Like when you are switching a song. Or even when you know its an emergency and you just have to answer it. If you are a parent and you child text saying they need you because they're not feeling well, have to text them back because they are not allowed to really use their phone in school so you can't call them.\\n\\nSo therefore drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. It is a distraction. It is one of the leading causes for car accidents. It is also a very expensive ticket so I encourage drivers to stay away from their phones while driving. Unless you absolutely need to use it.\\n\\n1            \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nToday, the majority of adults own and operate cell phones on a daily basis, such as, texting, calling, and being on social media communicating to one another. But while using a cell phone while driving in the other hand is utterly dangerous. First of all, you\\'re not supposed to have your cell phone out when driving in the first place! This increases the risks of an accident, and worst case scenario, death. Anything can happen if you look away even just for one second off the road.\\n\\nTo begin with, let\\'s talk about our senses really quick. We use our eyes to see, ears to hear, hands to touch, tongue to taste, and nose to smell. When we are driving we mainly use our eyes, ears, hands, and feet. We use our eyes to see the road, as well as other cars. For our hands we use the steering wheel to maneuver the vehicle, and our feet we use the pedals to determine the speed. Lastly, we use our ears to hear our surroundings. For example, if we were going to make a call/text on the cell phone, you will lose all of those abilities, because you are distracted doing two or more things at once.\\n\\nIn addition, the Hands Free Georgia Law states, \"all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state are prohibited from: Holding or supporting, with any part of the body, a wireless telecommunications device or stand-alone electronic device.\" This emphasizes that the driver is not allowed to write, send or read any text-based communication, including a text message, instant message, e-mail or internet data, according to the Georgia Department of Driver Services.\\n\\nLastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. The Alcohol Rehab Guide claimed that, you\\'ll have a \"slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment.\" These are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. On to the dangers of using cellphones while driving. The General Cell Phone Statistics reports, \"that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.\" These are numbers people need to start realizing that your life is more important than being on your phone communicating to someone else when driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, using your phones while driving is prohibited. Based from these reports, there were evident factors to the point that cell phone use while driving does cause accidents. Therefore, that\\'s why we have laws to prevent these irresponsible acts. Together we can end these numbers if we just take more control in ourselves.         ',\n",

Phones are incorporated in our jobs our sleep and are very important while driving. It is a commodity that is simply needed while driving. Drivers should be able to use cellphones while driving for navigation, work purposes, and overall, just entertainment.\\n\\nNowadays nobody understands how to use a map or atlas. One of the main ways people get around is phone GPS. People do not have time to try to read a map because life today is so fast. Also it is not dangerous because phone companies have made it safer to use the GPS on phones hands free. For many people cellphones are the most essential part of travel.\\n\\nIn life today we live in the fast lane. Due to that jobs usually require you to be available at almost any time. One of these times can be while driving. People simply don't have the time to wait and need to have conference calls or listen to work instructions over the phone. Many jobs also require people to be on the road a lot which means people have no choice but to use their phones.\\n\\nLastly radio is dead. Many people use their phones for entertainment in the car especially for long trips. People also use their phones if they just want to talk to a friend or family. The phone and app companies have taken those factors into account and have made it safer for people to use phones while driving. People shouldn't have to be bored out of their mind while driving.\\n\\nPhones are a new part of society that is taking over everywhere by storm.

The driver can be sitting still at a red light or even stopped in traffic, the driver cannot touch a cellphone. The first time a Georgia driver is caught on a cellphone, they could receive a fine of fifty dollars, and one point assigned against the driver\\'s license. A driver may have headsets and earpieces for communication purposes only. Not for listening to music or other entertainment. In Georgia, it is already against the law to wear both headphones in while driving, although a driver may have one earpiece in, both are not allowed.\\n\\nNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded that texting and driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated. Each day, roughly nine people are killed in crashes caused by distracted driving.\\n\\nAbout 3,285 deaths a year are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving distracts the driver by taking the eyes off the road, making drunk driving less dangerous because you have your eyes on the road at more times than looking at the phone. Over 94 percent of Georgia drivers support the hands free law. In 2017 there 39,773 gun related deaths in the U.S, in comparison an estimated 391,000 drivers were injured by distracted driving in 2017.\\n\\nIn 2013, ten percent of all drivers\\' ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Texting and driving is more common with teens than adults. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that\\'s enough time to travel the length of a football field. Texting and driving isn\\'t just dangerous for you and everyone on the road but it\\'s banned in most states. All it takes is that \"just once \"time for you to hurt yourself or someone else. Most people think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time. In every article you\\'ll see there\\'s no comparing texting while driving to anything else. In most states the penalty can be jail time for multiple offenders, you wouldn\\'t drive while blindfolded so for the safety for you, or whoever you may be with don\\'t text and drive.

But only way I say it is okay is if you're using your phone for directions and your using a stand for it and not holding it in your hand or if your phone is hooked up with your car. Like if you have Bluetooth and you're taking directions from there or taking calls too. Some people needs to use their phones if they are lost or it's an emergence. Another reason you shouldn't because if you put your phone in the passenger seat and it rings and most people take their eye off the road to pick it up and that can cause an accident.\\n\\nMost car accidents are because of distraction of phones like texting and driving, playing games on your phone or even video calling. People uses most of their time on their phone. Taking your eyes off the road can be so dangerous, even if you think it's a quick glace something can still happen. Just taking 5 seconds can be bad. It is very illegal to texts and drive or talking on the phone is. It is a total of 1.6 million of people getting in car crash over being on the phone. There is a big toll that it's mainly teenager who gets in car accident because of texting and driving.\\n\\nCan you go to jail for this crime? Well it depends on what state you're in because some say it's just a fine and some say you do jail time. The fines are up to 20$ -500$ and it depends on what state you're in. Texting and driving can be a very serious crime because you're getting someone hurt for your actions. You can really injure someone and your consequences will be jail time because you can kill someone. Not only you're going to jail but you just took an innocent people lives. While your texting and driving not only your hitting someone in their car but you can run a red light and that person that is crossing you can kill them.\\n\\nYou can also hurt the people that you are driving with. For an example say you and your family were taking a road trip and you guys are on the highway and you look down at your phone for 5 seconds to answer a call or message that can be a big accident. Now you just hurt you whole family just because you wanted to answer a call or text, was that message was really important enough that you had to put everyone else in danger. Not just your family will be hurt but somebody else family would be too. This is why I say people should not be able to use their phones while operating on a car because it is so dangerous and can put someone else's lives in danger.                   \",\n",

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car.

However, hands-free devices don't cut the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they were talking to and that it doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call for when there is an emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in-car.

When driving u should be alert and pay attention to all surroundings and while being on your phone u can lose focus and cause a accident. So to answer the question no u should not use a cellphone when driving.\\n\\nIn our current days we have become so focused on how much we can do at once that start to risk our personal safety because no matter where we go we cannot put our phones. We all know some stories of people texting while driving and causing accidents that's how you know that texting while driving is a very dangerous task. To make things clear when u start to text you are putting the lives of other people in your hands because u are careless to pay attention to the road at all times.\\n\\nEveryday their is a report of someone dying to a driver texting and driving. It's know that cellphones are the key factor that cause accidents. It doesn't matter what u tell people about the issue they will still use the cellphones and that's not okay because I don't feel safe just by walking down the street and a person hits me because they are not paying attention. I don't feel like my life should be in there hands. Some say maybe they are on a emergency call but you can put the phone on speaker without holding the phone to your ear and not driving with full control over the vehicle.\\n\\nTo put it all in perspective if we don't give up cellphones for our own safety the number of accidents will only increase. It's up to the people to take responsibility on this issue. People should just put the phones down get to there destination and then continue to use your phone. So to finish my essay I agree that yes we should not use cellphones when driving.         \",\n",
       " 'In today\\'s day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of di? erent drivers with di? erent experiences and di? erent skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to mulBtask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing tra? c with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distracBon since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don\\'t have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distracBon to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like\\n\\nGeorgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a ?ne of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.\\n\\nThe ?rst reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It\\'s been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to sur? ng the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,\"This one is preWy obvious, but did you know that you are 23 Bmes more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the NaBonal Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texBng while driving happen each year. If you don\\'t want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don\\'t text and drive.\" These staBsBcs show just how dangerous texBng and driving is and why people shouldn\\'t overlook this issue as it is a naBonal problem that doesn\\'t get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texBng while driving as they might have grown up with older ?gures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that states,\"Cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the NaBonal Highway Tra? c Safety AdministraBon, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distracBon-a? ected crashes, accounBng for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. TexBng while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and staBsBcs show that this mulBtasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texBng while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains o? the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.\" This arBcle shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it\\'s okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it\\'s never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start o? driving they are inexperienced and don\\'t know how to mulBtask. A car crash is one of the most traumaBzing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining\\n\\nPTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while mulBtasking in the car could result in a car crash.\\n\\nThe second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they\\'re with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,\"Not only does texBng and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to menBon pedestrians who oben end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to noBce them while looking at the phone in your lap.\" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people\\'s wrongdoing might a? ect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you\\'re willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that says,\"Because technology will change and new distracBons will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is conBnuously aWenBve and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracBng devices while driving.\\n\\nAccording to research conducted at Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the bene? ts of pugng away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks.\" This arBcle makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can a? ect someone\\'s mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be beWer drivers. Pugng their friends at risk and potenBally harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.\\n\\nDrivers should stop trying to mulBtask everything and do everything at once and just pay aWenBon to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one sel? sh person decides to not pay aWenBon and drive around clueless then everyone else su? ers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to sBll put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences gegng caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all mulBtasking while driving by using your phone only shows impaBence and immaturity. TexBng and driving has caused six Bmes more deaths than drunk driving yet people sBll shrug it o? due to them thinking they can manage to keep their aWenBon in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their Bme on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a noB?caBon immediately and wait and do it when the Bme is right.   ',\n",
       " \"Phones and Driving\\n\\nI think there pros and more cons in driving and using your Cell phone is unacceptable. But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. Because you're supposed to keep all your attention in driving and in the road all times. Texting and driving can kill in split seconds-just the amount of time it takes to send a quick text message. Cell phones cause many distractions, there are numerous amounts of risks while texting behind the wheel and it slows down your reaction time. Therefore its very dangerous using your phone and operating a vehicle be at the same time. Because anything can happen in any moment you can get in a harsh accident just by texting someone or just picking up or phone in general.\\n\\nCognitive distractors are anything that takes your mind off the road like engaging in a conversation via text or talking on the phone, or trying to operate your navigating system while route. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.\\n\\nIf you are texting and driving it's not a good idea unless if it's something extremely important for an example like important call very important and you need to know what it is or an important text that is necessary to know. Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death.\\n\\nTeens to the ages 16 and 18 are using their phones and driving they are getting find by the police. The find cost about $500 to $800 just because they were texting and driving. Many people think they're not a problem with texting and driving I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely.                                   \",\n",
       " \"Driving Safe\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use their phone and any device while operating a vehicle. The driver should be focused on the road and nothing else for that matter. Driving is a privilege for everyone and should be taken away if they take advantage of it. Cars were not invented until the late 19th century (1885 to be exact) People use to use a horse and buggy to get along or they would just walk. Now we have cars instead of the buggys. As stated before, it is a privilege.\\n\\nCar accidents were not as bad as they are now. Back then, they did not have all of these distractions as we do now. Like the ones we have at our fingertips. Cell phones are really big now; everyone owns one and everyone uses them. With that distraction right by the driver at all times, it is going to be very tempting to pick it up and look at it. They made new laws that were passed a year ago about using a device while driving. It is called the hands free law. This law was passed in 14 states. Also, in 38 states they have banned the use of cellphones while driving.\\n\\nDid you know ruffley 1.6 million crashes happen annually, queueing up to nearly 390,000 injuries each due by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. All due to the drivers using their cell phones while driving. It is not hard to drive and not touch or pick up your cell phones; just that habit we all picked up over time.\\n\\nDriving can be safe again when the cell phones are put up. Driving with them on us is too much of a temptation for us. There needs to be a way to have a safer life. There should be a car designed for your phone. You put your phone in or on something and that way, it's out of your reach. Plus, it starts your car that way if you pick it up the car will come to a safe stop.\\n\\nEliminating the risk of the driver wrecking the car in doing so hurting themselves and or others.\\n\\nThat is one way to help with this cell phone driving problem.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are many awful reasons that driving with a cellular device is bad. It can cause injuries and in some cases, death. It is a privilege to be driving and so for us to take advantage of it, it's not ok. And to put others and yourself in harm's way, it is not what you agree to when you take on the responsibility of driving. People should not be able to drive and use a cellular device at the same time.   \",\n",
       " 'Having your phone while driving, has been the topic of this generation for a very long time now. Some people feel like we are supposed to have our cellphones while driving, and others feel like we aren\\'t supposed to have our cellphones while driving. I\\'m one of those who are in favor of us NOT having our cellphones while driving. Let me tell you why, once you use your phone while on the road, you are going to lose focus of what\\'s on the road, and then you have become very distracted. Distracted driving is one of the biggest causes of car accidents today.\\n\\nWe are so interested in our cell phones, that we feel like everything we do, we have to have our phone with us. It\\'s like now we can\\'t live without the phone. So therefore, I don\\'t think drivers should be able to use a cellphone while driving. You are putting your own life and others at risk when you pick up your cellphone while driving. Once you pick up the cellphone, you become distracted. Your focus isn\\'t on the road anymore, it\\'s on your cell phone. So you don\\'t know what\\'s in front of you. Also, you set a bad example for children when you use your phone while driving. They will get into a car and think it\\'s okay to use their phone while driving. Then this big problem won\\'t be stopped.\\n\\nIf a driver gets into a car accident, and they realize it\\'s distracted driving, that driver can possibly be charged for murder. Even if they didn\\'t try to intentionally kill the other driver. They still will get charged for murder. Also, many people are addicted to the phones today. So maybe if we could put our phones down when driving, we might be able to put our phone down in other situations. It seems like today, our lives revolve around the phone. We feel like we need it doing everything, so maybe putting it down while we are driving will help us put it down more often.\\n\\nNow some people may say, \"Talking on the phone while driving isn\\'t bad\". It seems like to you, that you aren\\'t as distracted when driving, but in reality, you still are distracted even when just talking on the phone. You could simply hook up your phone to your car, to solve that problem. Even when just talking, you still have to answer and decline the phone. During that time you still have to look at your phone, and once again you become distracted. So talking on the phone while driving, is bad.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their cell phones while driving. Even if it\\'s just talking on the phone. They shouldn\\'t be able to use a phone while driving. Using the phone while driving causes distracted drivers. Which cause a lot of accidents and deaths. Not using the phone while driving will also help with the problem of constantly using cellphones. So, drivers shouldn\\'t be able to use their phones while driving.   ',\n",
       " \"Everyday people die or get injured in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone can put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving.\\n\\nOthers whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep in touch with customers and clients. However, because of their habits, they can create very dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to death or injury. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can affect their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.\\n\\nMany say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone imagine person who they're talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack of control, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the time.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of an emergency. However, it lacks safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable. Also you won't be able to even use your phone if the emergency is severe so it defeats the whole reason to use the phone if it's a life or death situation.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.         \",\n",

People nowadays have to be in contact with friends and family at every moment of the day especially while driving it is the equivalent of driving under the influence, using hand-held devices (like Bluetooth) will decrease the number of accidents caused by phones, and studies show texting reduces a persons reaction time.\\n\\nOne simulation showed talking on a cell phone is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger,the study concluded this because a passenger can take an active role in making the driver attentive of traffic and of course facilitate with directions.

       " 'No Phone While Driving\\n\\nIt is a well-known fact that the average person is not very coordinated or attentive. Along-side the fact that they are even more reckless with a phone in hand, so should they really be allowed to drive while actively using their phones. People should not be actively using their phone while driving.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is known that humans cannot physically or mentally multitask. The most common thing people mistake multitasking for is repeatedly shifting focus on things, and that may work in any casual setting but in case of driving it can be fatal. With the average American highway speeds at 55MPH or 80.67 Feet per second, and according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it takes four and a half seconds and another 144 feet to stop a car going at going at 50MPH assuming that the driver attentive to the road (\"Safety in Numbers\"). Going off of this, that is 1.5 secs reaction time (1.5sec x 80.67ft per sec = 121 feet) plus the 144 feet is takes to stop the actual car, and that come to a total 265 feet to stop a car going 55mph, with a driver who is not distracted by on the phone. With a phone a that only adds another additional 1 if being generous, which adds another 80.67 feet and brings the amount of road that it takes to stop a car to 345.67 feet. In which the additional 80 feet could have spared a life, but now has taken or seriously injured one.\\n\\nBack on the topic a multitasking, the repeated shifting of attention from one thing to another. This shifting of attention is not even the full 100% attention. In the case of driving, no one never not wants 100% of their attention on the road while piloting a two-ton metal beast. According to the article Multitasking: Switching Cost by the American Psychology Association, \"although switch costs may be relatively small, sometimes just a few tenths of a second per switch, they can add up to large amounts when people switch repeatedly back and forth between tasks\". Going back to the previous paragraph, those couple feet in which a driver is not fully aware of the road around them is incredibly dangerous, and now adding other drivers also not fully aware, that\\'s not a pretty sight.\\n\\nFinally, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,450 people were killed from distracted driving in 2016 and 391,000 people were injured in motor accidents involving distracted drivers in 2015. All these deaths and injuries could have been easily prevented if the driver just put down their phones for a second and payed attention to the road. It is obvious at this point, that the people aren\\'t meant to do more than one at a time, especially while operating a two ton metal beast.\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\n\"Safety in Numbers.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Aug. 2015, one. nhtsa. gov/nhtsa/Safety1nNum3ers/august2015/S1N_Aug15_Speeding_1. html.\\n\\n\"Multitasking: Switching Costs.\" American Psychological Association, 20 May 2006, www. apa. org/research/action/multitask. aspx.

       " \"Last call\\n\\nThere was a phone that was able to be carried anywhere, but it was large, thick, and heavy. Later technologists invented the new phone small, less heavy and just the right size for one's hand which is easy to carry everywhere and fit in a pocket. Before this new design, there was not a lot of phone use in cars and not so many accidents. Years later, the most popular phone is the iPhone by Apple. Many people buy phones because they use social media, Bluetooth, the internet, and other apps. Several people become distracted when they receive messages or notifications while driving because they pick up the phone to answer it. Using cell phones while driving should be banned to help decrease accidents, deaths, and legal consequences. Opponents of banning cell phone use while driving believes it is not the only distraction to drivers. What we should do is produce new technologies that make the practice safer for everyone.\\n\\nI agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that happen on a daily bases. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like the flu. Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many people with them. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc.\\n\\nThe more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. Driving requires a great amount of concentration, judgment, and precision when you are using a cell phone your concentration is greatly shifted from the road to the cell phone. When texting or calling a call they are not looking at the road they are looking at their cell phone within that split second you are putting your life and somebody else's life in danger. Many car accidents in the U.S are caused by texting while driving. If they ban cell phone usage while driving, they could save millions of lives, they will be more graduations rather than funerals.                                        \",\n",

       " 'Cell Phones & Driving\\n\\nAlthough cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.\\n\\nPeople use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.\\n\\nSometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.\\n\\nUnfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.\\n\\nAs a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can\\'t put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.\\n\\nOne such reason is that.\\n\\nWhen driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Stone, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Jimmy, says He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person\\'s life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away.

       " 'Phones and Driving\\n\\nOver time we\\'ve seen the consequences of phones and driving manifest itself in the form of negative impacts upon the world. Phones have negatively affected our people in ways that we have experienced so much pain through the increase in casualty rate. Although phones have had its positive advantages, phone have also had it\\'s disadvantage. Over time the increase in technological devices has caused many distraction in more ways than science can explain. Moreso we see this change and distraction throughout out cars and times of travel. Because of the way we are so emotionally attached to our phones, we forget the importance of many different situations at hand. However, drivers should not be able to operate their technological devices while in a vehicle.\\n\\nWhen the discussion is brought upon among the awareness of phones and driving, people get mad. They get frustrated in a manner that they feel the authority, police, and the people are in fact \" doing too much\". The vision that the people don\\'t see is the value of their lives and the correlation between that idea and cellphones in use while operating a vehicle. Studies and different statistics have shown the causes of death from the use of cell phones while driving. Within this modern society, different policies and ordinances have been put into place to show the importance of abstaining from the use of cellphones in the vehicles. Not only does using your cellphones in the car out your life in danger, but also the people surrounding you.\\n\\nThe authority and the government needs to make this social issue more aware to the public. The use of cellphones in our vehicles should be prohibited. Too much death and pain has been caused by devices like our cell phones. It is imperative that we make the people more aware on this issue. If we don\\'t take this matter seriously, we will continue to see the negative impact confide within our communitie, nation, and world as a whole. There should be no more talking about the issue and whether or not it should be prohibited. The answer is at hand. Drivers should not be on their devices while operating a vehicle.       ',\n",
       " \"Phones & Driving\\n\\nIt's no secret that cellphones have taken over today's society. We use them in the bathroom, at work, at school, wherever we go our cellphones are attached to our bodies and never seem to be away from us for too long. So it's also no secret that sometimes we use them when we're not supposed to or at the most inappropriate times possible. The tragic truth is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to deadly car crashes. On average, 9 of these daily deaths are related to unfocused driving. Despite these striking numbers, people continue to put their lives as well as other's lives in danger simply because they can't wait. Though some individuals support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid operating their phone at all while driving.\\n\\nSome say that hands-free set is safe because people can drive using both their hands. But, hands-free devices don't exclude the threat of causing an accident and may even be worse. Researches show that using a headset or ear/headphones can be as hazardous as holding a phone because the conversations sidetracks drivers from concentrating on the road. The problem is when a car swerves suddenly or a pedestrian step into the road, and the brain lacks the processing power to respond in time. So the problem isn't holding the wheel and the cell phone at the same time, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at that particular time. Drivers need to put all their focus on driving and paying attention to their surroundings so they can keep themselves and other as safe as possible.\\n\\nWorkers that are lawyers or businessmen of any kind may argue that their hectic lives and chaotic work schedule require them to always be in the reach of their cellphone. As understandable as this is, they are unaware that the habits they are creating could lead to serious danger.\\n\\nBusiness matters can be tense and unsafe while driving because it can cause emotional responses that can lead to disaster. They may get in a heated argument with a coworker and get upset, this can lower their driving ability and cloud their judgement that can lead to them losing control of the car. Work should never be more valued than a life. So if people don't make a choice to put away their cell phones their routine and hazardous habits can harm innocent people.\\n\\nOpponents say that cell phones are blameless because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. Though, this could be acceptable in some cases, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or they can't reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully hinge on having a cell phone because they are not reliable and are not guaranteed to help you when you need it to.\\n\\nConcluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of deaths on the roads and around the world will continue to increase. It is our duty to implicate good habits into those around us. People will continue to die if a change is not made immediately. It is the peoples' responsibility to not danger their own and others people lives. It can wait.    \",\n",
       " \"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Distracted driving is one of the most common causes of road accidents. One of the main reasons why you shouldn't be using your phone while driving, because the human mind is easy to get distracted. Which leads you in a dished. Leading to and unnecessary crash.\\n\\nWorldwide over 1.6 million crashes happen each year. Nearly over 300 hundred k people are injured. From accidents caused by texting while driving. In the United States approximately 9 people are killed and over a thousand were injured in crashes because they were distracted. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Teens have been the largest age group reported driving distracted. It has been reported to be over 50% of teens crashes. People should stop driving with cell phones because it end other people's lives. Even a two minute drive going to the store of you picking up your phone can cause a crash. Might not be a major crash but it could ´ve been avoided. Should only be on your phone if you're parked.\\n\\nPeople should have an hands-free set in the car it's safe because they can drive using two hands. Like in the state of Georgia it's illegal to hold your phone while driving even at a red light. The driver can't have the phone touching them while on the phone. It must be on a hands free setup. Hand free stands are helpful. Plus you don't have to worry about getting pulled over. And it somewhat helps the diver from getting distracted.\\n\\nAll states should consider making it illegal to hold phones while driving. Therefore the average car wreck will go down. These wrecks cause innocent lives leaving loved ones without their family member.    \",\n",
       " 'Phones & Driving\\n\\nIn 2018, 77% of the people in the United States own a smartphone. It is no secret that everyone is constantly checking their phone whether it be for games, music or social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 660,000 drivers use their cell phones daily while behind the wheel. People are even willing to put their lives and/or the lives of others on the line all for a notification popping up on their screen. Using a phone while operating a vehicle should continue to be prohibited. It is a game of life and death to not only the driver, but the people around them as well.\\n\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or (NHTSA), classifies using a phone while driving as \"distracted driving.\" In 2017 alone there were 3,166 fatalities related to distracted driving (NHTSA). Even if you\\'re lucky to survive an accident due to distracted driving, there is still a risk of major injuries. According to teensafe. com, \"2.35 million people in the US are injured or disabled by car crashes every year. More than 330,000 of these crashes that cause severe injury are caused by texting and driving,\" (teensafe. com). This proves that phones have a key part in many accidents. They could\\'ve been typing a short response or reading a paragraph. The fact is that they were distracted instead of paying attention to the road. The NHTSA states, \"sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that\\'s like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed,\" (NHTSA). In conclusion, by cancelling out the use of phones/electronic devices while driving, the risk of injury/death is greatly reduced.\\n\\nWhile texting and driving can put you at risk of bodily harm, it can also cost you some jail time and put your wallet in harm\\'s way. Anyone who has been in a car wreck knows how expensive it can be. Not to mention any medical bills, lawsuits, tickets/fines, etc. In Georgia just getting pulled over for texting and driving can cost you $150 and a point on your driver license (drivinglaws. org). Not to mention if you actually collide with another person and seriously injure them, you may face serious jail time. \"If you are texting while driving and you kill someone, you can expect to be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter with an aggravating factor. The crime can potentially carry a penalty as high as any other manslaughter charge that arises from a gross indifference to the safety of others. It could be as high as 20 years in some circumstances,\" (drivinglaws. org). The consequences are just not worth it. Keeping your attention on the road and the other people around you is the only thing you should worry about while driving. In conclusion, texting and driving accidents when they aren\\'t fatal can still get you into a lot of trouble.\\n\\nAlthough texting and driving puts you at risk of fines, jail time, or even DEATH, there are other alternatives; like the \"Hands-Free Driving\" that persuades people into buying phone stands for their cars. With the phone stand, the phone is either at eye-level below the rear view mirror or down to the side either on your left or right. By simply moving the phone to a different angle, people think that it\\'s simply going to reduce the risk of texting and driving. The \"Old\" way of texting and driving was to have the phone in a position where your eyes weren\\'t even near the road, but now the \"new and improved\" texting and driving now has your peripherals as your safeguard from motor accidents. The main issue with \"distracted driving\" specifically texting and driving was not that your hands not being on the wheel was causing accidents; it was that people\\'s eyes were on their phone screen instead of the road. \"Hands-Free\" texting and driving only solves a minor part of a major problem. Before \"Hands-Free \\'\\' texting and driving was more of a sharpened skill because of the task of averting your hand(s) and eyes to type a message all without running into oncoming traffic or running into anyone else. In short, \"hands-free\" isn\\'t a safe alternative to texting and driving.\\n\\nThe prohibition of ANYONE using a cellular device while driving, for ANYTHING, will reduce the risk of distracted driving accidents, and the consequences of said accidents, (fines/fees, jail time, and even the ultimate price, life). In conclusion, people should continue to not be allowed to use a phone while driving, so put that phone down and focus on the road ahead. Rather have them wait for a response and make it safe than never make it at all.         ',\n",

In the next paragraphs, I'm going to explain my reasons fully. Each of these reasons is the main reasons why it should be stopped. If we do control this, it could make fewer accidents happen.\\n\\nPhones and driving are a huge part of deaths today. Many people are dying because they get distracted. Mostly teens are dying from texting and driving. Crashes happen a lot from being on the phone. They happen more commonly than people think they do. These are common because everyone is big on technology. This texting and driving issue is a huge problem.\\n\\nDamages are done when people text and drive. When crashes are caused by this, it causes damages around. Your car can be badly damaged after wrecking which is a lot of money. It could even cause damage to other buildings or other government places. Damages from wrecks can cause a lot of money expenses.\\n\\nBeing on your phone should never happen because it causes a lot of problems. Damages to buildings, cars, and other cars are all too much just to send a text or something.\\n\\nWhen people drive and text it can injure other people. You could swerve and hit some other people. You can hit other cars injuring another person in the car. You can crash and injure someone in the car with you. When you crash you are most likely to hurt someone when crashing. People shouldn't have to worry about getting into a crash because of other people wanting to text.\\n\\nI highly think texting and driving should definitely be illegal. There should be consequences for people who do it. Texting and driving is a huge cause of death lately. It may not be the main reason but its too common.\\n\\nThese issues cause a lot of problems and not even deaths. For example, stated in the other paragraphs death, damages, and injuries to others are big problems too. This should definitely be fixed and there wouldn't be so many deaths from it.       \",\n",

This is an unsafe behavior that deserves great attention and society needs to come together to come up with a plan to prevent future accidents.\\n\\nIt is true that everyday more and more businesses conduct their activities online and most jobs require employees to be on their phones for a large amount of time, prospecting and client outreach may come at an unexpected time, and some may argue that the act of being the phone while driving is often times necessary to conduct business, this however comes at a great cost, and the risks associated with this behavior could be fatal according to experts at a local university in Kansas.\\n\\n9 people are killed and more than 1,000 are injured daily in incidents reported as distraction-affected crashes in the United State (\"FCC\"), and in 2013 it was reported that, according to a national survey in the US, the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four. (\"USA Today\")\\n\\nThe bottom line is that Phones and motored vehicles do not mix well and the action of using a cellular device while driving must be avoided.

       " \"Focus On The Road\\n\\nDo you think you should be on your device while driving a vehicle? It's very dangerous and most people don't even think about it. Most people get distracted because of social media or to even text a friend. Electronic devices today are a big distraction in today's world causing lack of communication, lack of exercising and a lot of problems. Teenagers have the most accidents while driving because they're either on the phone or talking to someone. You should use the phone when you arrive at your destination. Until then focus on the road.\\n\\nWhile being on the road you should be able to focus on your location and other cars around you. You shouldn't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the road. Traffic goes on a lot and you shouldn't worry about picking up a phone. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly than you expect. Some people may think there are professionals at multitasking but it's wrong. Try to avoid distractions so you can be safe.\\n\\nIt is bad to use your phone while driving because it is dangerous. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing videos, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. Crashes are increasing every year because of distracted driving. Distracted driving is one of the biggest and most common reasons. It's caused by any activity that takes your attention off the road. The only time you should use your phone is when you need help going somewhere. If you need help getting around you can use your GPS on your phone. Before you get in the car you should set up your GPS and put it in a spot you can keep glazing at. You should also use a bluetooth device to help you communicate. Also if something happens to you pull over and call Someone.\\n\\nDrivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Without cell phone distractions the rate of car crashes will decrease. So do you think you should be on your device while driving?   \",\n",
       " \"I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents.\\n\\nStudies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.\\n\\nAnother reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.   \",\n",
       " 'While almost everyone owns and uses a mobile device, using them while behind the wheel of a vehicle should be prohibited.\\n\\nWhile mobile devices are useful in everyday life, they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved. Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, \"the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year\" (Edgar Snyder & Associates \"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving\"). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle.\\n\\nAlthough a crash may not seem that bad, some of these crashes result in many deaths and injuries. In a 2018 study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it states that distracted driving claims over 2,841 lives (Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov 2020). These numbers represent not only the drivers, but also include their passengers and any pedestrians who have died as a result of the negligence and recklessness of drivers distracted by mobile devices. The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary. The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place.\\n\\nOne of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident. Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase. The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation. While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive. The law office of Tavss Fletcher states that \"the average cost for each death in a motor vehicle accident is $1,130,000\" and \"each nonfatal disabling injury is $61,600\" (\"The Price Paid for Automobile Accidents and Injuries\"). So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident.\\n\\nOn top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim\\'s families. When a victim survives and they are injured, they can\\'t immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives. They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm \"Some physical injuries limit victims\\' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you\\'re suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it\\'s no surprise you may become depressed\" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new \"normal\" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult. Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated. Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost.\\n\\nAside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it. Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time. One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that \"A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content\"(\"Hands-Free Law\"). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control.\\n\\nThe use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.\\n\\nWorks Cited\\n\\nAndrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov. \"U Drive.

It is simply not safe and can lead to dangerous and heart wrenching moments. Cell phone use while driving needs to be banned nationwide. It will not cease to occur unless people see and hear the damage it can inflict.\\n\\nWhen someone is using their phone while operating a motor vehicle, it takes a significant amount of attention away from the road, and onto the phone instead. Looking down at a cell phone for 5 sec while going just 55 mph means that you have just crossed the length of an entire football field without looking up at the road. The AAA Foundation For Traffic Safety ranked using a hands-free mobile device as a level 2 distraction and texting while operating a vehicle as a level 3 distraction, the highest level. Such distractions are unacceptable when operating a motor vehicle, it could lead to injuries or worse. A study conducted by Cambridge Mobile Telematics revealed that roughly 52% of drives that resulted in a crash were caused by distracted driving, and roughly eleven teens die per day as a result of texting and driving. Inexperienced drivers, such as teens, are more prone to engage in distracted driving, and are more likely to suffer a crash or accident when engaging in distracted driving. Having your attention focused on anything other than the road is a terrible and dangerous idea, and should not be tolerated under any circumstance.\\n\\nWilliams 2\\n\\nUsing a phone while driving, be it calling, texting, or anything else, can lead to horrible and heartbreaking injuries and even deaths. In 2016 alone, distracted driving took the lives of 3,450 drivers, and injured over 300,000 more. Using a phone while driving is a gamble with death. The CDC reports that nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured daily as a result of distracted driving. Despite knowing these facts, many drivers still report that they engage in distracted driving, usually via phone. The individuals who choose not to use their phone while driving realize the consequences of distracted driving, and choose to seek the benefits of not using a phone while driving. Cell phone use while driving is a horrible practice. Sending a text is most certainly not worth a human life.\\n\\nUsing a phone while on the road is, as said, a dangerous practice, and must come to an end. The best way to prevent phone use on the road is legislation. New laws or stricter punishments on these laws would likely reduce the likelihood that people would choose to text or call while driving. There are ways to prevent phone use while driving that do not necessarily involve government. Making sure individuals, especially teens, know the risks behind using a phone while driving can persuade them to stop or not start. For teens, stricter penalties from parents would also dissuade them. Give instructions to new drivers to specifically not get on their phone while operating a motor vehicle.\\n\\nWilliams 3\\n\\nUsing a phone while driving, or being distracted by any piece of technology for that matter, is not acceptable. Lives have been lost, many have been injured, and vehicles have been totaled, all because of a call or text message. Laws must be put in place, and knowledge must be spread to end this practice. When driving, please put your phone down, and instead focus your attention to the task at hand.                                  \",\n",
       " 'Texting While Driving\\n\\nTexting while driving is not good. Some people text their friends while driving and some people text for work on the road. Other people text while driving to save time.\\n\\nMore people have phones now and they are using them constantly. That means that texting while driving has also increased. Texting while driving should be against the law because it is causing more injuries and deaths than before cell phones were invented.\\n\\nTexting while driving is dangerous. Texting while driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents on the road. Studies have shown that cell phone texting is the cause of 1.6 million crashes every year, with 330,000 people injured in them ( tellrobert). There are probably thousands more accidents that are not reported because many drivers hide this information from the police. Injuries are not the only problem. Many people are dying because of texting while driving too. One study found that in 2016, 3,450 deaths were a result of texting while driving and is the leading preventable cause of death among teenagers now (Christopher ). The number of injuries and deaths alone is enough reason texting while driving should be against the law.\\n\\nSurprisingly, there are still people out there texting and driving. These people believe that they are responsible enough to avoid wrecks and crashes (debate). Others think that since they are Americans they should be able to have the freedom to choose (debate). They think that they are above the rules . It is unfortunate that these people still text and drive when the consequences are so high.\\n\\nTexting while driving has proven to be dangerous for everyone. The people who do it think they are bigger and better than other people. But why should their rights be more important than the rights of other people on the road? Shouldn\\'t the other people on the road have the right to be protected, too? Is a text more important than a life?\\n\\nWork Cited\\n\\nChristopher. \"3 Reasons You Shouldn\\'t Use Your Cell Phone While Driving.\\'\\' www. whiplashstlouis. com/author/chris/\\n\\nCornell, Scott. \"What Are the Dangers of Using Cell Phones While Driving?\\'\\' www. itstillworks. com/dangers-using-cell-phones-driving-1253. html\\n\\n\"Should people be able to talk on their cell phone while they are driving?\\'\\' www. debate. org/opinions/should-people-be-able-to-talk-on-their-cell-phone-whil-they-are-dri ving\\n\\n\"The dangers of cell phone use while driving.\\'\\' www. tellrobert. com/the-dangers-of-cell-phone-use-while-driving/               ',\n",
       " \"TEXTING & DRIVING Texting and driving is not what we need and American. We as teens think it's cool to drive fast\\n\\nAnd want attention and were not thinking about someone getting hurt.

       " \"Cellphones & Driving\\n\\nYou're driving down the street and your phone is blowing up. It's your son Ron he's got that bad thing again with his stomach. You text Ron back and let him know you're driving ...or have a whole conversation with him trying to be a good parent and direct him to the medicine bag, again. Next thing you know flashing lights are behind you looking to give you ticket that ranges from 250$ to 2,750$ and if he doesn't he can be fined 11,000 dollars. Is it right to have cellular devices out while driving? Was this situation an acceptance? In this essay I will inform you on whether I believe having your devices out is wrong or right and have supporting facts and details.\\n\\nWhat are possible reasons when driving with a cellphone? There are at least 3 if you're a service driver and you need (directions). Two is in case of last minute call (urgent phone-call). Three, if your receiving an important phone call.\\n\\nThese still aren't acceptable to the law tho. In the state of Georgia having a phone in your hands leads you straight to a ticket. I say these three things because I agree but because it's known that everybody does this out of Bad habit, it's going to happen. An average of 62.9 percent of the world owned a cellphone in the year 2016. Cellphones and he internet is a fast growing thing these days, some people can't keep away from them, but that doesn't mean it's okay to use them while driving there's a time and a place for that. I don't agree with those that use their cellphones incorrectly while driving. Technology is growing and the world has to learn how to adapt to it in safer matters, not texting and driving or taking selfies behind the wheel. There really aren't any real good excuses for being on it all the time while driving, there's built in GPS, and Bluetooth so for those reasons I said are acceptable aren't. Maybe the if it's in your hand ticket things a little too far but safety first.\\n\\nCellphones and driving is risky and has a bad effect to the world. 1 out of 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the united states. An estimated amount of 1.6million car crashes happen a year from it. Almost 390,000 injuries a year happen leaving people paralyzed when people text and drive with a high death rate. The fines and jail time aren't nice especially in bad cases. Those aren't acceptable numbers or is it worth the risk, don't expect your insurance to save you either. Please don't text and drive, be safe, and beware because your putting yourself and those around you at risk.\\n\\nWork cited\\n\\n? Georgia Law | Georgia. gov\\n\\n?

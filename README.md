BOT OR NOT: DETECTING LLM GENERATED TEXTS

The amount of text generated by LLMs in the past 2 years has increased 5x folds.
Generate text could include malicious content like fake news, incorrect information and other malicious content 
Detecting source of these LLM generated text should be priority, and thus we created traditional machine learning models that can do that for us (ironic)
The project overall involves analyzing many paragraphs generated by both humans and LLMs, creating encoding atop those paragraphs and subsequently predicting the source of the paragraphs
